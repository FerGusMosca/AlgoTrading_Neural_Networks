The Trust&#8217;s purpose is to hold Bitcoins, which are digital assets that are created and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer Bitcoin Network, a decentralized network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols. There are several key features of the Bitcoin Network, including the maximum block size used by the network. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm, which is preferred for parallel processing, but is also easily used to build application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to mine the network more efficiently. Bitcoin has a current block size of 1MB and, on average blocks are generated every ten minutes. Bitcoin&#8217;s halvings take place approximately every four years, occurring every 210,000 blocks. Additionally, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million. As of December&#160;31, 2022, Bitcoin&#8217;s circulating supply was 19.2&#160;million coins. As of December&#160;31, 2022, the 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin was approximately $4.1 billion. As of December&#160;31, 2022, the aggregate market value of Bitcoin was $318.5 billion. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&#160;31, 2022, the Trust holds approximately 3.3% of the Bitcoin in circulation. The size of the Trust&#8217;s position does not itself enable the Sponsor or the Trust to participate in or otherwise influence the development of the Bitcoin Network. As a decentralized digital asset network, the Bitcoin Network consists of several stakeholders, including core developers of Bitcoin, users, services, businesses, miners and other constituencies, of which the Trust is only one constituent. Furthermore, in contrast to other protocols in which token holders participate in the governance of the network, ownership of Bitcoin confers no such rights. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&#160;11, 2019, the Trust changed its name from Bitcoin Investment Trust to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) by filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State. The Trust issues common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (&#8220;Shares&#8221;), which represent ownership in the Trust, on a periodic basis to certain &#8220;accredited investors&#8221; within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) in exchange for deposits of Bitcoin. The Shares are quoted on OTC Markets Group Inc.&#8217;s OTCQX<sup style="font-size:75%; vertical-align:top">&#174;</sup> Best Marketplace (&#8220;OTCQX&#8221;) under the ticker symbol &#8220;GBTC.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Grayscale Investments, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;), Delaware Trust Company is the trustee of the Trust (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;), Continental Stock Transfer&#160;&amp; Trust Company is the transfer agent of the Trust (in such capacity, the &#8220;Transfer Agent&#8221;), Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC is the custodian of the Trust (the &#8220;Custodian&#8221;) and BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon, is the administrator of the Trust (the &#8220;Administrator&#8221;). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust issues Shares only in one or more blocks of 100 Shares (a block of 100 Shares is called a &#8220;Basket&#8221;) to certain authorized participants (&#8220;Authorized Participants&#8221;) from time to time. Baskets are offered in exchange for Bitcoins. At this time, the Sponsor is not operating a redemption program for the Shares and therefore Shares are not redeemable by the Trust. Due to the lack of an ongoing redemption program as well as price volatility, trading volume and closings of Digital Asset Exchanges due to fraud, failure, security breaches or otherwise, there can be no assurance that the value of the Shares will reflect the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, and the Shares may trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. dollar value of a Basket of Shares at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date of a creation order is equal to the Basket Amount, which is the number of Bitcoins required to create a Basket of Shares, multiplied by the &#8220;Index Price,&#8221; which is the price of a Bitcoin calculated by applying a weighting algorithm to the price and trading volume data for the immediately preceding 24-hour period as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, derived from the selected Digital Asset Exchanges that are reflected in the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) (the &#8220;Index&#8221;) on each business day. The Index Price is calculated using non-GAAP methodology and is not used in the Trust&#8217;s financial statements. See &#8220;&#8212;Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market&#8212;Bitcoin Value&#8212;The Index and the Index Price.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Basket Amount is determined by dividing (x)&#160;the number of Bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such trade date, after deducting the number of Bitcoins representing the U.S. dollar value of accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust (converted using the Index Price at such time, and carried to the eighth decimal place), by (y)&#160;the number of Shares outstanding at such time (with the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one Bitcoin (i.e., carried to the eighth decimal place)), and multiplying such quotient by 100. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Shares are neither interests in nor obligations of the Sponsor or the Trustee. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor maintains an Internet website at www.grayscale.com/products/grayscale/bitcoin-trust/, through which the registrant&#8217;s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section&#160;13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are made available free of charge after they have been filed or furnished to the SEC.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Investment Objective </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust&#8217;s investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on Bitcoin per Share) to reflect the value of Bitcoin held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities. To date, the Trust has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Bitcoin held by the Trust, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event the Shares trade at a substantial premium, investors who purchase Shares on OTCQX will pay substantially more for their Shares than investors who purchase Shares in the private placement. The value of the Shares may not reflect the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, for a variety of reasons, including the holding period under Rule 144 for Shares purchased in the private placement, the lack of an ongoing redemption program, any halting of creations by the Trust, Bitcoin price volatility, trading volumes on, or closures of, exchanges where digital assets trade due to fraud, failure, security breaches or otherwise, and the non-current trading hours between OTCQX and the global exchange market for trading Bitcoin. As a result, the Shares may continue to trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, and the Trust may be unable to meet its investment objective for the foreseeable future. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, from May&#160;5, 2015 to December&#160;31, 2022, the maximum premium of the closing price of the Shares quoted on OTCQX over the value of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share was 142% and the average premium was 37%, and the maximum discount of the closing price of the Shares quoted on OTCQX below the value of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share was 49% and the average discount was 23%. The closing price of the Shares, as quoted on OTCQX at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each business day between May 5, 2015 to December 31, 2022, has been quoted at a discount on 468 days. As of December&#160;30, 2022, the last business day of the period, the Trust&#8217;s Shares were quoted on OTCQX at a discount of 45% to the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Secondary Market Trading.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in Bitcoin, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost- effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to Bitcoin. A substantial direct investment in Bitcoin may require expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the acquisition, security and safekeeping of the Bitcoin and may involve the payment of substantial fees to acquire such Bitcoin from third-party facilitators through cash payments of U.S. dollars. Because the value of the Shares is correlated with the value of the Bitcoin held by the Trust, it is important to understand the investment attributes of, and the market for, Bitcoin. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shares purchased in the private placement are restricted securities that may not be resold except in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act and state securities laws and any such transaction must be approved in advance by the Sponsor. In determining whether to grant approval, the Sponsor will specifically look at whether the conditions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, including the requisite holding period thereunder, and any other applicable laws have been met. Any attempt to sell the Shares without the approval of the Sponsor in its sole discretion will be void ab initio. See &#8220;&#8212;Description of the Shares&#8212;Transfer Restrictions&#8221; for more information. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to Rule 144, the minimum holding period for Shares purchased in the private placement is six months. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are carried, for financial statement purposes, at fair value, as required by the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The Trust determines the fair value of Bitcoins based on the price provided by the Digital Asset Market that the Trust considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The net asset value of the Trust determined on a GAAP basis is referred to in this Annual Report as &#8220;NAV.&#8221; See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8212;Principal Market and Fair Value Determination&#8221; for more information on the Trust&#8217;s principal market selection. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust uses the Index Price to calculate its &#8220;Digital Asset Holdings,&#8221; which is the aggregate value, expressed in U.S. dollars, of the Trust&#8217;s assets (other than U.S. dollars, other fiat currency, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency), less the U.S. dollar value of the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities calculated in the manner set forth under &#8220;&#8212;Valuation of Bitcoin and Determination of Digital Asset Holdings.&#8221; &#8220;Digital Asset Holdings per Share&#8221; is calculated by dividing Digital Asset Holdings by the number of Shares currently outstanding. Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Digital Asset Holdings is not intended to be a substitute for the Trust&#8217;s NAV calculated in accordance with GAAP, and Digital Asset Holdings per Share is not intended to be a substitute for the Trust&#8217;s NAV per Share calculated in accordance with GAAP. </p>

If such relief is granted and the Sponsor approves a redemption program, the Shares will be redeemable in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and the relevant Participant Agreement. Although the Sponsor cannot predict with certainty what effect, if any, the operation of a redemption program would have on the trading price of the Shares, a redemption program would allow Authorized Participants to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities created when the market value of the Shares deviates from the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, which may have the effect of reducing any premium or discount at which the Shares trade on OTCQX over or below such value, respectively, which at times has been substantial. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For a discussion of risks relating to the deviation in the trading price of the Shares from the Digital Asset Holdings per Share, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares&#8212;Because of the holding period under Rule 144, the lack of an ongoing redemption program and the Trust&#8217;s ability to halt creations from time to time, there is no arbitrage mechanism to keep the value of the Shares closely linked to the Index Price and the Shares have historically traded at a substantial premium over, and a substantial discount to, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share, &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212; Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares&#8212;The Shares may trade at a price that is at, above or below the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share as a result of the non-current trading hours between OTCQX and the Digital Asset Exchange Market,&#8221; &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares&#8212;Shareholders may suffer a loss on their investment if the Shares trade above or below the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share&#8221;&#160;and &#8220;Item 1A.

In addition, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, dissolve the Trust for a number of reasons, including if the Sponsor determines, in its sole discretion, that it is desirable or advisable for any reason to discontinue the affairs of the Trust. For example, if the Sponsor determines that Bitcoin is a security under the federal securities laws, whether that determination is initially made by the Sponsor itself, or because the SEC or a federal court subsequently makes that determination, the Sponsor does not intend to permit the Trust to continue holding Bitcoin in violation of the federal securities laws (and therefore would either dissolve the Trust or potentially seek to operate the Trust in a manner that complies with the federal securities laws, including the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;)). See &#8220;&#8212;Description of the Trust Agreement&#8212;The Trustee&#8212;Termination of the Trust&#8221; for additional discussion of the circumstances under which the Trust could be dissolved. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to the Trust and the Shares&#8212;A determination that Bitcoin or any other digital asset is a &#8220;security&#8221; may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and the value of the Shares, and result in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to, or termination of, the Trust.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Characteristics of the Shares </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in Digital Asset Markets through an investment in securities. As of December&#160;31, 2022, each Share represented approximately 0.0009 of one Bitcoin. The logistics of accepting, transferring and safekeeping of Bitcoins are dealt with by the Sponsor and Custodian, and the related expenses are built into the value of the Shares. Therefore, shareholders do not have additional tasks or costs over and above those generally associated with investing in any other privately placed security. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Shares have certain other key characteristics, including the following: </p> <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. The Bitcoin Network allows people to exchange tokens of value, called Bitcoin, which are recorded on a public transaction ledger known as a Blockchain. Bitcoin can be used to pay for goods and services, or it can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, at rates determined on Digital Asset Markets that trade Bitcoin or in individual end-user-to-end-user transactions under a barter system. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bitcoin Network is decentralized in that it does not require governmental authorities or financial institution intermediaries to create, transmit or determine the value of Bitcoin. Rather, Bitcoin is created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a &#8220;mining&#8221; process. The value of Bitcoin is determined by the supply of and demand for Bitcoin on the Digital Asset Markets or in private end-user-to-end-user transactions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">New Bitcoin are created and rewarded to the miners of a block in the Blockchain for verifying transactions. The Blockchain is effectively a decentralized database that includes all blocks that have been mined by miners and it is updated to include new blocks as they are solved. Each Bitcoin transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin Network and, when included in a block, recorded in the Blockchain. As each new block records outstanding Bitcoin transactions, and outstanding transactions are settled and validated through such recording, the Blockchain represents a complete, transparent and unbroken history of all transactions of the Bitcoin Network. For further details, see &#8220;&#8212;Creation of New Bitcoin&#8221; below. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Bitcoin </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bitcoin Network was initially contemplated in a white paper that also described Bitcoin and the operating software to govern the Bitcoin Network. The white paper was purportedly authored by Satoshi Nakamoto. However, no individual with that name has been reliably identified as Bitcoin&#8217;s creator, and the general consensus is that the name is a pseudonym for the actual inventor or inventors. The first Bitcoins were created in 2009 after Nakamoto released the Bitcoin Network source code (the software and protocol that created and launched the Bitcoin Network). The Bitcoin Network has been under active development since that time by a group of engineers known as core developers. </p>

Bitcoin transactions may be made directly between end-users without the need for a third-party intermediary. To prevent the possibility of double-spending Bitcoin, a user must notify the Bitcoin Network of the transaction by broadcasting the transaction data to its network peers. The Bitcoin Network provides confirmation against double-spending by memorializing every transaction in the Blockchain, which is publicly accessible and transparent. This memorialization and verification against double-spending is accomplished through the Bitcoin Network mining process, which adds &#8220;blocks&#8221; of data, including recent transaction information, to the Blockchain. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Brief Description of Bitcoin Transfers </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to engaging in Bitcoin transactions directly on the Bitcoin Network, a user generally must first install on its computer or mobile device a Bitcoin Network software program that will allow the user to generate a private and public key pair associated with a Bitcoin address commonly referred to as a &#8220;wallet.&#8221; The Bitcoin Network software program and the Bitcoin address also enable the user to connect to the Bitcoin Network and transfer Bitcoin to, and receive Bitcoin from, other users. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each Bitcoin Network address, or wallet, is associated with a unique &#8220;public key&#8221; and &#8220;private key&#8221; pair. To receive Bitcoin, the Bitcoin recipient must provide its public key to the party initiating the transfer. This activity is analogous to a recipient for a transaction in U.S. dollars providing a routing address in wire instructions to the payor so that cash may be wired to the recipient&#8217;s account. The payor approves the transfer to the address provided by the recipient by &#8220;signing&#8221; a transaction that consists of the recipient&#8217;s public key with the private key of the address from where the payor is transferring the Bitcoin. The recipient, however, does not make public or provide to the sender its related private key. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Neither the recipient nor the sender reveal their private keys in a transaction, because the private key authorizes transfer of the funds in that address to other users. Therefore, if a user loses his private key, the user may permanently lose access to the Bitcoin contained in the associated address. Likewise, Bitcoin is irretrievably lost if the private key associated with them is deleted and no backup has been made. When sending Bitcoin, a user&#8217;s Bitcoin Network software program must validate the transaction with the associated private key. The resulting digitally validated transaction is sent by the user&#8217;s Bitcoin Network software program to the Bitcoin Network to allow transaction confirmation. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some Bitcoin transactions are conducted &#8220;off-blockchain&#8221; and are therefore not recorded in the Blockchain. Some &#8220;off- blockchain transactions&#8221; involve the transfer of control over, or ownership of, a specific digital wallet holding Bitcoin or the reallocation of ownership of certain Bitcoin in a pooled-ownership digital wallet, such as a digital wallet owned by a Digital Asset Exchange. In contrast to on-blockchain transactions, which are publicly recorded on the Blockchain, information and data regarding off-blockchain transactions are generally not publicly available. Therefore, off-blockchain transactions are not truly Bitcoin transactions in that they do not involve the transfer of transaction data on the Bitcoin Network and do not reflect a movement of Bitcoin between addresses recorded in the Blockchain. For these reasons, off-blockchain transactions are subject to risks as any such transfer of Bitcoin ownership is not protected by the protocol behind the Bitcoin Network or recorded in, and validated through, the blockchain mechanism. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Summary of a Bitcoin Transaction </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In a Bitcoin transaction directly on the Bitcoin Network between two parties (as opposed to through an intermediary, such as a custodian), the following circumstances must initially be in place: (i)&#160;the party seeking to send Bitcoin must have a Bitcoin Network public key, and the Bitcoin Network must recognize that public key as having sufficient Bitcoin for the transaction; (ii)&#160;the receiving party must have a Bitcoin Network public key; and (iii)&#160;the spending party must have internet access with which to send its spending transaction. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The receiving party must provide the spending party with its public key and allow the Blockchain to record the sending of Bitcoin to that public key. After the provision of a recipient&#8217;s Bitcoin Network public key, the spending party must enter the address into its Bitcoin Network software program along with the number of Bitcoin to be sent. The number of Bitcoin to be sent will typically be agreed upon between the two parties based on a set number of Bitcoin or an agreed upon conversion of the value of fiat currency to Bitcoin. Since every computation on the Bitcoin Network requires the payment of Bitcoin, including verification and memorialization of Bitcoin transfers, there is a transaction fee involved with the transfer, which is based on computation complexity and not on the value of the transfer and is paid by the payor with a fractional number of Bitcoin. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the entry of the Bitcoin Network address, the number of Bitcoin to be sent and the transaction fees, if any, to be paid, will be transmitted by the spending party. The transmission of the spending transaction results in the creation of a data packet by the spending party&#8217;s Bitcoin Network software program, which is transmitted onto the decentralized Bitcoin Network, resulting in the distribution of the information among the software programs of users across the Bitcoin Network for eventual inclusion in the Blockchain. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed in greater detail below in &#8220;&#8212;Creation of New Bitcoin,&#8221; Bitcoin Network miners record transactions when they solve for and add blocks of information to the Blockchain. When a miner mines for a block, it creates that block, which includes data relating to (i) newly submitted and accepted transactions; (ii) a reference to the prior block in the Bitcoin Blockchain; and (iii) the satisfaction of the consensus mechanism to mine the block. The miner becomes aware of outstanding, unrecorded transactions through the data packet transmission and distribution discussed above. </p>

Once a transaction is confirmed on the Blockchain, it is irreversible. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Creation of New Bitcoin </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">New Bitcoins are created through the mining process as discussed below. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bitcoin Network is kept running by computers all over the world. In order to incentivize those who incur the computational costs of securing the network by validating transactions, there is a reward that is given to the computer that was able to create the latest block on the chain. Every 10 minutes, on average, a new block is added to the Blockchain with the latest transactions processed by the network, and the computer that generated this block is currently awarded 6.25 Bitcoin. Due to the nature of the algorithm for block generation, this process (generating a &#8220;proof-of-work&#8221;) is guaranteed to be random. Over time, rewards are expected to be proportionate to the computational power of each machine. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process by which Bitcoin is &#8220;mined&#8221; results in new blocks being added to the Blockchain and new Bitcoin tokens being issued to the miners. Computers on the Bitcoin Network engage in a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to the Blockchain and thereby confirm Bitcoin transactions included in that block&#8217;s data. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To begin mining, a user can download and run Bitcoin Network mining software, which turns the user&#8217;s computer into a &#8220;node&#8221; on the Bitcoin Network that validates blocks. Each block contains the details of some or all of the most recent transactions that are not memorialized in prior blocks, as well as a record of the award of Bitcoin to the miner who added the new block. Each unique block can be solved and added to the Blockchain by only one miner. Therefore, all individual miners and mining pools on the Bitcoin Network are engaged in a competitive process of constantly increasing their computing power to improve their likelihood of solving for new blocks. As more miners join the Bitcoin Network and its processing power increases, the Bitcoin Network adjusts the complexity of the block-solving equation to maintain a predetermined pace of adding a new block to the Blockchain approximately every ten minutes. A miner&#8217;s proposed block is added to the Blockchain once a majority of the nodes on the Bitcoin Network confirms the miner&#8217;s work. Miners that are successful in adding a block to the Blockchain are automatically awarded Bitcoin for their effort and may also receive transaction fees paid by transferors whose transactions are recorded in the block. This reward system is the method by which new Bitcoin enter into circulation to the public. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bitcoin Network is designed in such a way that the reward for adding new blocks to the Blockchain decreases over time. Once new Bitcoin tokens are no longer awarded for adding a new block, miners will only have transaction fees to incentivize them, and as a result, it is expected that miners will need to be better compensated with higher transaction fees to ensure that there is adequate incentive for them to continue mining. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Limits on Bitcoin Supply </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The supply of new Bitcoin is mathematically controlled so that the number of Bitcoin grows at a limited rate pursuant to a pre- set schedule. The number of Bitcoin awarded for solving a new block is automatically halved after every 210,000 blocks are added to the Blockchain. Currently, the fixed reward for solving a new block is 6.25 Bitcoin per block and this is expected to decrease by half to become 3.125 Bitcoin after the next 210,000 blocks have entered the Bitcoin Network, which is expected to be mid-2024. This deliberately controlled rate of Bitcoin creation means that the number of Bitcoin in existence will increase at a controlled rate until the number of Bitcoin in existence reaches the pre-determined 21&#160;million Bitcoin. As of December&#160;31, 2022, approximately 19.2&#160;million Bitcoins were outstanding and the date when the 21&#160;million Bitcoin limitation will be reached is estimated to be the year 2140. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Modifications to the Bitcoin Protocol </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin is an open source project with no official developer or group of developers that controls the Bitcoin Network. However, the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s development is overseen by a core group of developers. The core developers are able to access, and can alter, the Bitcoin Network source code and, as a result, they are responsible for quasi-official releases of updates and other changes to the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s source code. The release of updates to the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s source code does not guarantee that the updates will be automatically adopted. Users and miners must accept any changes made to the Bitcoin source code by downloading the proposed modification of the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s source code. A modification of the Bitcoin Network&#8217;s source code is effective only with respect to the Bitcoin users and miners that download it. If a modification is accepted by only a percentage of users and miners, a division in the Bitcoin Network will occur such that one network will run the pre-modification source code and the other network will run the modified source code. Such a division is known as a &#8220;fork.&#8221; See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to Digital Assets&#8212;A temporary or permanent &#8220;fork&#8221; could adversely affect the value of the Shares.&#8221; Consequently, as a practical matter, a modification to the source code becomes part of the Bitcoin Network only if accepted by participants collectively having most of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network. In the past, there have been several forks in the Bitcoin Network, including, but not limited to, forks resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash (August 1, 2017), Bitcoin Gold (October 24, 2017) and Bitcoin SegWit2X (December 28, 2017), among others. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Core development of the Bitcoin Network source code has increasingly focused on modifications of the Bitcoin Network protocol to increase speed and scalability and also allow for non-financial, next generation uses. For example, following the recent activation of Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin Network, an alpha version of the Lightning Network was released. The Lightning Network is an open-source decentralized network that enables instant off-Blockchain transfers of the ownership of Bitcoin without the need of a trusted third party. The system utilizes bidirectional payment channels that consist of multi-signature addresses. One on-Blockchain transaction is needed to open a channel and another on-Blockchain transaction can close the channel. Once a channel is open, value can be transferred instantly between counterparties, who are engaging in real Bitcoin transactions without broadcasting them to the Bitcoin Network. New transactions will replace previous transactions and the counterparties will store everything locally as long as the channel stays open to increase transaction throughput and reduce computational burden on the Bitcoin Network. Other efforts include increased use of smart contracts and distributed registers built into, built atop or pegged alongside the Blockchain. For example, the white paper for Blockstream, an organization that includes core developer Pieter Wuille, calls for the use of &#8220;pegged sidechains&#8221; to develop programming environments that are built within Blockchain ledgers that can interact with and rely on the security of the Bitcoin Network and Blockchain, while remaining independent from them. Open-source projects such as RSK are a manifestation of this concept and seek to create the first open-source, smart contract platform built on the Blockchain to enable automated, condition-based payments with increased speed and scalability. The Trust&#8217;s activities will not directly relate to such projects, though such projects may utilize Bitcoin as tokens for the facilitation of their non-financial uses, thereby potentially increasing demand for Bitcoin and the utility of the Bitcoin Network as a whole. Conversely, projects that operate and are built within the Blockchain may increase the data flow on the Bitcoin Network and could either &#8220;bloat&#8221; the size of the Blockchain or slow confirmation times. At this time, such projects remain in early stages and have not been materially integrated into the Blockchain or the Bitcoin Network. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2021, the Bitcoin protocol implemented the Taproot upgrade to add enhanced support for complex transactions on the network such as multi-signature transactions, which require two or more parties to execute a transaction on the Bitcoin network. Prior to the upgrade, multi-signature transactions were historically slow, expensive, and easily identifiable.

Moreover, there may be variances in the prices of Bitcoin on the various Digital Asset Exchanges, including as a result of differences in fee structures or administrative procedures on different Digital Asset Exchanges. For example, based on data provided by the Index Provider, on any given day during the year ended December&#160;31, 2022, the maximum differential between the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of any single Digital Asset Exchange included in the Index and the Index Price was 0.34% and the average of the maximum differentials of the 4:00 p.m., New York time, spot price of each Digital Asset Exchange included in the Index and the Index Price was 0.23%. During this same period, the average differential between the 4:00 p.m., New York time, spot prices of all the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Index and the Index Price was 0.0002%. All Digital Asset Exchanges that were included in the Index throughout the period were considered in this analysis. To the extent such prices differ materially from the Index Price, investors may lose confidence in the Shares&#8217; ability to track the market price of Bitcoin. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Index and the Index Price </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Index is a U.S. dollar-denominated composite reference rate for the price of Bitcoin. The Index is designed to (1)&#160;mitigate the effects of fraud, manipulation and other anomalous trading activity from impacting the Bitcoin reference rate, (2)&#160;provide a real-time, volume-weighted fair value of Bitcoin and (3)&#160;appropriately handle and adjust for non-market related events. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Index Price is determined by the Index Provider through a process in which trade data is cleansed and compiled in such a manner as to algorithmically reduce the impact of anomalistic or manipulative trading. This is accomplished by adjusting the weight of each data input based on price deviation relative to the observable set, as well as recent and long-term trading volume at each venue relative to the observable set. The Index Price is calculated using non-GAAP methodology and is not used in the Trust&#8217;s financial statements. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to February&#160;1, 2022, the Trust valued its Bitcoins for operational purposes by reference to a volume-weighted average index price (the &#8220;Old Index Price&#8221;) of a Bitcoin in U.S. dollars calculated by applying a weighting algorithm to the price and trading volume data for the immediately preceding 24-hour period as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, derived from the selected Digital Asset Exchanges reflected in the Index on such trade date. The Old Index Price was calculated using the same methodology as the Index Price with an additional averaging mechanism overlaid to the price produced resulting in the Old Index Price reflecting an average price for the 24-hour period. In other words, the Index Price is the price of a Bitcoin at 4:00 p.m., New York time, calculated based on the price and trading volume data of the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Index over the preceding 24-hour period whereas the Old Index Price was the price of a Bitcoin at 4:00 p.m., New York time, calculated by taking the average of each price of a Bitcoin produced by the Index over the preceding 24-hour period. All references to the Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share of the Trust in this report have been calculated using the Index Price unless indicated otherwise. </p>

The Index Provider does not currently include data from over-the-counter markets or derivatives platforms among the Constituent Exchanges. Over-the-counter data is not currently included because of the potential for trades to include a significant premium or discount paid for larger liquidity, which creates an uneven comparison relative to more active markets. There is also a higher potential for over-the-counter transactions to not be arms-length, and thus not be representative of a true market price. Bitcoin derivative markets are also not currently included as the markets remain relatively thin. While the Index Provider has no plans to include data from over-the-counter markets or derivative platforms at this time, the Index Provider will consider IOSCO principles for financial benchmarks, the management of trading venues of Bitcoin derivatives and the aforementioned Inclusion Criteria when considering whether to include over-the-counter or derivative platform data in the future. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Index Provider and the Sponsor have entered into the index license agreement, dated as of February&#160;1, 2022 (the &#8220;Index License Agreement&#8221;), governing the Sponsor&#8217;s use of the Index Price. Pursuant to the terms of the Index License Agreement, the Index Provider may adjust the calculation methodology for the Index Price without notice to, or consent of, the Trust or its shareholders. The Index Provider may decide to change the calculation methodology to maintain the integrity of the Index Price calculation should it identify or become aware of previously unknown variables or issues with the existing methodology that it believes could materially impact its performance and/or reliability. The Index Provider has sole discretion over the determination of Index Price and may change the methodologies for determining the Index Price from time to time. Shareholders will be notified of any material changes to the calculation methodology or the Index Price in the Trust&#8217;s current reports and will be notified of all other changes that the Sponsor considers significant in the Trust&#8217;s periodic or current reports. The Trust will determine the materiality of any changes to the Index Price on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with external counsel. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Index Provider may change the trading venues that are used to calculate the Index or otherwise change the way in which the Index is calculated at any time. For example, the Index Provider has scheduled quarterly reviews in which it may add or remove Constituent Exchanges that satisfy or fail the Inclusion Criteria. The Index Provider does not have any obligation to consider the interests of the Sponsor, the Trust, the shareholders, or anyone else in connection with such changes. While the Index Provider is not required to publicize or explain the changes or to alert the Sponsor to such changes, it has historically notified the Trust of any material changes to the Constituent Exchanges, including any additions or removals of the Constituent Exchanges, in addition to issuing press releases in connection with the same. The Sponsor will notify investors of any such material event by filing a current report on Form 8-K. Although the Index methodology is designed to operate without any manual intervention, rare events would justify manual intervention. Intervention of this kind would be in response to non-market-related events, such as the halting of deposits or withdrawals of funds on a Digital Asset Exchange, the unannounced closure of operations on a Digital Asset Exchange, insolvency or the compromise of user funds. In the event that such an intervention is necessary, the Index Provider would issue a public announcement through its website, API and other established communication channels with its clients. </p>

For example, assume that for a one-hour period, the digital asset&#8217;s execution prices on one Constituent Exchange were trading more than 7% higher than the average execution prices on another Constituent Exchange.

Any similar attacks on the Bitcoin Network that impact the ability to transfer Bitcoin could have a material adverse effect on the price of Bitcoin and the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Market Participants </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Miners </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Miners range from Bitcoin enthusiasts to professional mining operations that design and build dedicated machines and data centers, including mining pools, which are groups of miners that act cohesively and combine their processing power to solve blocks. When a pool mines a new block, the pool operator receives the Bitcoin and, after taking a nominal fee, splits the resulting reward among the pool participants based on the processing power each of them contributed to mine such block. Mining pools provide participants with access to smaller, but steadier and more frequent, Bitcoin payouts.

Historically, larger financial services institutions are publicly reported to have limited involvement in investment and trading in digital assets, although the participation landscape is beginning to change. Currently, there is relatively limited use of digital assets in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively extensive use by speculators, and a significant portion of demand for digital assets is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of digital assets. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Retail Sector </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The retail sector includes users transacting in direct peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions through the direct sending of Bitcoin over the Bitcoin Network.

Binance.US, Coinbase Pro, Kraken and LMAX Digital are some of the largest Digital Asset Exchanges by volume traded. Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, the Custodian for the Trust, is a digital asset custodian that provides custodial accounts that store Bitcoin for users. As the Bitcoin Network continues to grow in acceptance, it is anticipated that service providers will expand the currently available range of services and that additional parties will enter the service sector for the Bitcoin Network. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Competition </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&#160;31, 2022, more than 22,000 other digital assets, as tracked by CoinMarketCap.com, have been developed since the inception of Bitcoin, which is currently the most developed digital asset because of the length of time it has been in existence, the investment in the infrastructure that supports it, and the network of individuals and entities that are using Bitcoin in transactions. Some industry groups are also creating private, permissioned blockchain versions of digital assets. For example, J.P. Morgan and others are developing an open source platform called Quorum, which is described as a version of Ethereum designed for use by the financial services industry.

Asset Markets, with particular focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges or other service providers that hold or custody digital assets for users. Many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. President Biden&#8217;s March&#160;9, 2022 Executive Order, asserting that technological advances and the rapid growth of the digital asset markets &#8220;necessitate an evaluation and alignment of the United States Government approach to digital assets,&#8221; signals an ongoing focus on digital asset policy and regulation in the United States. A number of reports issued pursuant to the Executive Order have focused on various risks related to the digital asset ecosystem, and have recommended additional legislation and regulatory oversight. In addition, federal and state agencies, and other countries and international bodies have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of digital asset transactions or requirements for businesses engaged in digital asset activity. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the SEC, U.S. state securities regulators and several foreign governments have issued warnings and instituted legal proceedings in which they argue that certain digital assets may be classified as securities and that both those digital assets and any related initial coin offerings are subject to securities regulations. The outcomes of these proceedings, as well as ongoing and future regulatory actions may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of an investment in the Shares or the ability of the Trust to continue to operate. Additionally, U.S. state and federal, and foreign regulators and legislatures have taken action against virtual currency businesses or enacted restrictive regimes in response to adverse publicity arising from hacks, consumer harm, or criminal activity stemming from virtual currency activity. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2021, the chair of the SEC stated that he believed investors using digital asset trading platforms are not adequately protected, and that activities on the platforms can implicate the securities laws, commodities laws and banking laws, raising a number of issues related to protecting investors and consumers, guarding against illicit activity, and ensuring financial stability. The chair expressed a need for the SEC to have additional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from &#8220;falling between regulatory cracks,&#8221; as well as for more resources to protect investors in &#8220;this growing and volatile sector.&#8221; The chair called for federal legislation centering on digital asset trading, lending, and decentralized finance platforms, seeking &#8220;additional plenary authority&#8221; to write rules for digital asset trading and lending. At the same time, the chair has also stated that the SEC has authority under existing laws to regulate the digital asset sector. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC has also recently proposed amendments to the custody rules under Rule 406(4)-2 of the Investment Advisers Act. The proposed rule changes would amend the definition of a &#8220;qualified custodian&#8221; under Rule 206(4)-2(d)(6) and expand the current custody rule under Rule 406(4)-2 to cover digital assets and related advisory activities. If enacted as proposed, these rules would likely impose additional regulatory requirements with respect to the custody and storage of digital assets and could lead to additional regulatory oversight of the digital asset ecosystem more broadly. In addition, it is possible the market turbulence in late 2022, which led to the failure of FTX Trading Ltd. (&#8220;FTX&#8221;) in November 2022 and the resulting market turmoil, could lead to increased SEC or criminal investigations, enforcement, and/or other regulatory activity across the digital asset ecosystem.

Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to the Regulation of the Trust and the Shares&#8212;Regulatory changes or actions by the U.S. Congress or any U.S. federal or state agencies may affect the value of the Shares or restrict the use of Bitcoin, mining activity or the operation of the Bitcoin Network or the Digital Asset Exchange Market in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares,&#8221; &#8220;Item 1A.

On January&#160;11, 2019, the Trust changed its name from Bitcoin Investment Trust to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) by filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the DSTA.

The Trust is passive and is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins will be transferred out of the Digital Asset Account only in the following circumstances: (i)&#160;transferred to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee or any Additional Trust Expenses, (ii)&#160;sold on an as-needed basis to pay Additional Trust Expenses or (iii)&#160;sold on behalf of the Trust in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets or as otherwise required by law or regulation. Assuming that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each delivery or sale of Bitcoins by the Trust to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee or any Additional Trust Expenses will be a taxable event for shareholders.

The Trust will not trade, buy, sell or hold Bitcoin derivatives, including Bitcoin futures contracts, on any futures exchange. The Trust is authorized solely to take immediate delivery of actual Bitcoin. The Sponsor does not believe the Trust&#8217;s activities are required to be regulated by the CFTC under the CEA as a &#8220;commodity pool&#8221; under current law, regulation and interpretation. The Trust will not be operated by a CFTC-regulated commodity pool operator because it will not trade, buy, sell or hold Bitcoin derivatives, including Bitcoin futures contracts, on any futures exchange. Investors in the Trust will not receive the regulatory protections afforded to investors in regulated commodity pools, nor may the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange or any futures exchange enforce its rules with respect to the Trust&#8217;s activities.

A Basket equals a block of 100 Shares. The number of outstanding Shares is expected to increase from time to time as a result of the creation of Baskets. The creation of Baskets will require the delivery to the Trust of the number of Bitcoins represented by the Baskets being created. The creation of a Basket will be made only in exchange for the delivery to the Trust of the number of whole and fractional Bitcoins represented by each Basket being created, the number of which is determined by dividing (x)&#160;the number of Bitcoins owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the relevant trade date, after deducting the number of Bitcoins representing the U.S. dollar value of accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust (converted using the Index Price at such time, and carried to the eighth decimal place) by (y)&#160;the number of Shares outstanding at such time (with the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one Bitcoin (<span style="font-style:italic">i.e.</span>, carried to the eighth decimal place)), and multiplying such quotient by 100. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although the redemption of Shares is provided for in the Trust Agreement, the redemption of Shares is not currently permitted and the Trust does not currently operate a redemption program.

The Trust has not sought such relief as of the date of this Annual Report. Even if such relief is sought in the future, no assurance can be given as to the timing of such relief or that such relief will be granted. If such relief is granted and the Sponsor approves a redemption program, the Shares will be redeemable in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and the relevant Participant Agreement. Although the Sponsor cannot predict with certainty what effect, if any, the operation of a redemption program would have on the trading price of the Shares, this will allow Authorized Participants to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities created when the market value of the Shares deviates from the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, which may have the effect of reducing any premium at which the Shares trade on OTCQX over such value or cause the Shares to trade at a discount to such value, which at times has been substantial. </p>

The Sponsor expects that the market price of the Shares will fluctuate over time in response to the market prices of Bitcoins. In addition, because the Shares reflect the estimated accrued but unpaid expenses of the Trust, the number of Bitcoins represented by a Share will gradually decrease over time as the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are used to pay the Trust&#8217;s expenses.

In order to send digital assets from a digital wallet in which the private keys are kept in cold storage, either the private keys must be retrieved from cold storage and entered into an online, or &#8220;hot&#8221;, digital asset software program to sign the transaction, or the unsigned transaction must be transferred to the cold server in which the private keys are held for signature by the private keys and then transferred back to the online digital asset software program. At that point, the user of the digital wallet can transfer its digital assets. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Security Procedures </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Custodian is the custodian of the Trust&#8217;s private keys in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Custodian Agreement. Transfers from the Digital Asset Account requires certain security procedures, including but not limited to, multiple encrypted private key shards, usernames, passwords and 2-step verification. Multiple private key shards held by the Custodian must be combined to reconstitute the private key to sign any transaction in order to transfer the Trust&#8217;s assets. Private key shards are distributed geographically in secure vaults around the world, including in the United States. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, if any one secure vault is ever compromised, this event will have no impact on the ability of the Trust to access its assets, other than a possible delay in operations, while one or more of the other secure vaults is used instead. These security procedures are intended to remove single points of failure in the protection of the Trust&#8217;s assets. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Transfers of Bitcoins to the Digital Asset Account will be available to the Trust once processed on the Blockchain. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to obtaining regulatory approval to operate a redemption program and authorization of the Sponsor, the process of accessing and withdrawing Bitcoins from the Trust to redeem a Basket by an Authorized Participant will follow the same general procedure as transferring Bitcoins to the Trust to create a Basket by an Authorized Participant, only in reverse.

Shares will be issued only in Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 100 Shares) in connection with creations. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. The Shares are quoted on OTCQX under the ticker symbol &#8220;GBTC&#8221;. On January&#160;26, 2018, the Trust completed a 91-for-1 Share split of the Trust&#8217;s issued and outstanding Shares. In connection with the Share Split, shareholders of record on January&#160;22, 2018 received ninety additional Shares of the Trust for each Share held. The number of outstanding Shares and per-Share amounts disclosed for periods prior to January&#160;26, 2018 have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Share Split, as applicable. </p> <p style="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Description of Limited Rights </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Shares do not represent a traditional investment and should not be viewed as similar to &#8220;shares&#8221; of a corporation operating a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. A shareholder will not have the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which shareholders may vote under the Trust Agreement. For example, shareholders do not have the right to elect or remove directors and will not receive dividends. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights or, except as discussed below, any redemption rights or rights to distributions. </p> <p style="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Voting and Approvals </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The shareholders take no part in the management or control of the Trust. Under the Trust Agreement, shareholders have limited voting rights. For example, in the event that the Sponsor withdraws, a majority of the shareholders may elect and appoint a successor sponsor to carry out the affairs of the Trust. In addition, no amendments to the Trust Agreement that materially adversely affect the interests of shareholders may be made without the vote of at least a majority (over 50%) of the Shares (not including any Shares held by the Sponsor or its affiliates). However, the Sponsor may make any other amendments to the Trust Agreement in its sole discretion without shareholder consent provided that the Sponsor provides 20 days&#8217; notice of any such amendment. </p> <p style="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Distributions </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust may make distributions on the Shares in-cash or in-kind, including in such form as is necessary or permissible for the Trust to facilitate its shareholders&#8217; access to any Incidental Rights or to IR Virtual Currency. </p> <p style="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, if the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Sponsor will distribute to the shareholders any amounts of the cash proceeds of the liquidation remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Sponsor will determine. See &#8220;&#8212;Description of the Trust Agreement&#8212;The Trustee&#8212;Termination of the Trust.&#8221; Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Transfer Agent for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portions of any distribution. </p> <p style="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Appointment of Agent </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, by holding the Shares, shareholders will be deemed to agree that the Sponsor may cause the Trust to appoint an agent (any person appointed in such capacity, an &#8220;Agent&#8221;) to act on their behalf in connection with any distribution of Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency if the Sponsor has determined in good faith that such appointment is reasonably necessary or in the best interests of the Trust and the shareholders in order to facilitate the distribution of any Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency. The Sponsor may cause the Trust to appoint Grayscale Investments, LLC (acting other than in its capacity as Sponsor) or any of its affiliates to act in such capacity. </p> <p style="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any Agent appointed to facilitate a distribution of Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency will receive an in-kind distribution of Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency on behalf of the shareholders of record with respect to such distribution, and following receipt of such distribution, will determine, in its sole discretion and without any direction from the Trust, or the Sponsor, in its capacity as Sponsor of the Trust, whether and when to sell the distributed Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency on behalf of the record date shareholders. If the Agent is able to do so, it will remit the cash proceeds to the record date shareholders. There can be no assurance as to the price or prices for any Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency that the Agent may realize, and the value of the Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency may increase or decrease after any sale by the Agent. </p> <p style="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any Agent appointed pursuant to the Trust Agreement will not receive any compensation in connection with its role as agent. However, any Agent will be entitled to receive from the record-date shareholders, out of the distributed Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency, an amount of Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency with an aggregate fair market value equal to the amount of administrative and other reasonable expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with its activities as agent of the record-date shareholders, including expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with any post-distribution sale of such Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency. </p> <p style="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor currently expects to cause the Trust to appoint Grayscale Investments, LLC, acting other than in its capacity as Sponsor, as Agent to facilitate any distribution of Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency to shareholders. The Trust has no right to receive any information about any distributed Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency or the disposition thereof from the record date shareholders, their Agent or any other person. </p>

A Basket equals 100 Shares. As of December&#160;31, 2022, each Share represented approximately 0.0009 of one Bitcoin. See &#8220;&#8212; Description of Creation of Shares.&#8221; The creation of a Basket requires the delivery to the Trust of the number of Bitcoins represented by one Share immediately prior to such creation multiplied by 100. The Trust may from time to time halt creations, including for extended periods of time, for a variety of reasons, including in connection with forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Redemption of Shares </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Effective October&#160;28, 2014, the Trust suspended its redemption program, in which shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their Shares through Genesis, the sole Authorized Participant at that time, out of concern that the redemption program was in violation of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. On July&#160;11, 2016, Genesis and the Trust entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC whereby they agreed to a cease-and-desist order against future violations of Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Genesis also agreed to pay disgorgement of $51,650.11 in redemption fees it collected, plus prejudgment interest of $2,105.68, for a total of $53,755.79. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Redemptions of Shares are currently not permitted and the Trust is unable to redeem Shares.

If such relief is granted and the Sponsor approves a redemption program, the Shares will be redeemable only in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and the relevant Participant Agreement. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares&#8212;Because of the holding period under Rule 144, the lack of an ongoing redemption program and the Trust&#8217;s ability to halt creations from time to time, there is no arbitrage mechanism to keep the value of the Shares closely linked to the Index Price and the Shares have historically traded at a substantial premium over, and a substantial discount to, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share,&#8221; &#8220;Item 1A.

In determining whether to grant approval, the Sponsor will specifically look at whether the conditions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and any other applicable laws have been met.

Any Shares that qualify for the removal of the Rule 144 transfer restriction legends are presented to outside counsel, who may instruct the Transfer Agent to remove the transfer restriction legends from the Shares, allowing the Shares to then be resold without restriction, including on OTCQX U.S. Premier marketplace.

The Basket Amount multiplied by the number of Baskets being created is the &#8220;Total Basket Amount.&#8221; The number of Bitcoins represented by a Share will gradually decrease over time as the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are used to pay the Trust&#8217;s expenses. As of December&#160;31, 2022, each Share represented approximately 0.0009 of one Bitcoin. Information regarding the number of Bitcoin represented by each Share is posted to the Trust&#8217;s website daily at www.grayscale.com/products/grayscale-bitcoin- trust/. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Authorized Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create Baskets. Each Authorized Participant must (i)&#160;be a registered broker-dealer, (ii)&#160;enter into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and (iii)&#160;own a Bitcoin wallet address that is recognized by the Custodian as belonging to the Authorized Participant or such Authorized Participant&#8217;s Liquidity Provider. An Authorized Participant may act for its own account or as agent for investors who have entered into a subscription agreement with the Authorized Participant (each such investor, an &#8220;Investor&#8221;). An Investor that enters into a subscription agreement with an Authorized Participant subscribes for Shares by submitting a purchase order and paying a subscription amount, either in U.S. dollars or in Bitcoins, to the Authorized Participant. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An Investor may pay the subscription amount in cash or Bitcoins. In the event that the Investor pays the subscription amount in cash, the Authorized Participant, or Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant, purchases Bitcoin in a Digital Asset Market or, to the extent the Authorized Participant, or Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant, already holds Bitcoin, the Authorized Participant, or Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant, may contribute such Bitcoin to the Trust. Depending on whether the Investor wires cash to the Authorized Participant before or after 4:00 p.m. New York time, the Investor&#8217;s Shares will be created based on the same or next business day&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings and the risk of any price volatility in Bitcoin during this time will be borne by the Authorized Participant, or Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant will receive Shares of the Trust, and the Shares will then be registered in the name of the Investor. In the event that the Investor pays the subscription amount in Bitcoins, the Investor will transfer such Bitcoins to the Authorized Participant, which will contribute such Bitcoins in kind to the Trust, and receive Shares of the Trust, and the Shares will then be registered in the name of the Investor. For the avoidance of doubt, in either case, the Authorized Participant will act as the agent of the Investor with respect to the contribution of Bitcoins to the Trust in exchange for Shares. </p>

The Sponsor, from time to time, may temporarily waive all or a portion of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee of the Trust in its discretion for stated periods of time. Presently, the Sponsor does not intend to waive any of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee for the Trust and there are no circumstances under which the Sponsor has determined it will definitely waive the fee. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee will generally be paid in Bitcoins. However, if the Trust holds any Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency at any time, the Trust may also pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee, in whole or in part, with such Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency by entering into an agreement with the Sponsor and transferring such Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency to the Sponsor at a value to be determined pursuant to such agreement. However, the Trust may use Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee only if such agreement and transfer do not otherwise conflict with the terms of the Trust Agreement. The value of any such Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency will be determined on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. The Trust currently expects that the value of any such Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency would be determined by reference to an index provided by the Index Provider or, in the absence of such an index, by reference to the cascading set of rules described in &#8220;Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market&#8212;Bitcoin Value&#8212;The Index and the Index Price.&#8221; If the Trust pays the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee in Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency, in whole or in part, the amount of Bitcoin that would otherwise have been used to satisfy such payment will be correspondingly reduced. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the Trust&#8217;s payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee to the Sponsor, the Sponsor may elect to convert the Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency received as payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee into U.S. dollars. The rate at which the Sponsor converts such Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency to U.S. dollars may differ from the rate at which the relevant Sponsor&#8217;s Fee was determined.

If Additional Trust Expenses are incurred, the Trust will be required to pay these Additional Trust Expenses by selling or delivering Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency. Generally, the Sponsor will cover such expenses on behalf of the Trust and the Trust will reimburse the Sponsor by delivering to the Sponsor Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in an amount equal to such expenses. When the Trust and the Sponsor, acting on behalf of the Trust, sell or deliver, as applicable, Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency, they generally do not transact directly with counterparties other than the Authorized Participant or other similarly eligible financial institutions that are subject to federal and state licensing requirements and maintains practices and policies designed to comply with AML and KYC regulations. </p>

See &#8220;&#8212;Disposition of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency&#8221; for further information on sales or other dispositions of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency. Although the Sponsor cannot definitively state the frequency or magnitude of Additional Trust Expenses, the Sponsor expects that they may occur infrequently. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor or any of its affiliates may be reimbursed only for the actual cost to the Sponsor or such affiliate of any expenses that it advances on behalf of the Trust for payment of which the Trust is responsible. In addition, the Trust Agreement prohibits the Trust from paying to the Sponsor or such affiliate for indirect expenses incurred in performing services for the Trust in its capacity as the Sponsor (or an affiliate of the Sponsor) of the Trust, such as salaries and fringe benefits of officers and directors, rent or depreciation, utilities and other administrative items generally falling within the category of the Sponsor&#8217;s &#8220;overhead.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Disposition of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To cause the Trust to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee, the Sponsor will instruct the Custodian to (i)&#160;withdraw from the Digital Asset Account the number of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency, determined as described above in &#8220;&#8212;Expenses; Sales of Bitcoins,&#8221; equal to the accrued but unpaid Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and (ii)&#160;transfer such Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor at such times as the Sponsor determines in its absolute discretion. In addition, if the Trust incurs any Additional Trust Expenses, the Sponsor or its delegates (i)&#160;will instruct the Custodian to withdraw from the Digital Asset Account Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses and (ii)&#160;may either (x)&#160;cause the Trust to convert such Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate or (y)&#160;when the Sponsor incurs such expenses on behalf of the Trust, cause the Trust (or its delegate) to deliver such Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in kind to the Sponsor, in each case in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses. The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and Additional Trust Expenses payable by the Trust will generally be paid in Bitcoin. Shareholders do not have the option of choosing to pay their proportionate shares of Additional Trust Expenses in lieu of having their shares of Additional Trust Expenses paid by the Trust&#8217;s delivery or disposition of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency. Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the transfer or sale of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency to pay the Trust&#8217;s expenses will be a taxable event for shareholders. See &#8220;Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences&#8212;Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the number of Bitcoins held by the Trust will decrease as a consequence of the payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee in Bitcoins or the sale of Bitcoins to pay Additional Trust Expenses (and the Trust will incur additional fees associated with converting Bitcoins into U.S. dollars), the number of Bitcoins represented by a Share will decline at such time and the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings may also decrease. Similarly, the number (if any) of Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency represented by a Share will decrease as a consequence of the use of Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and Additional Trust Expenses. Accordingly, the shareholders will bear the cost of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and any Additional Trust Expenses. New Bitcoins deposited into the Digital Asset Account in exchange for additional new Baskets issued by the Trust will not reverse this trend. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor will also cause the sale of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency if the Sponsor determines that sale is required by applicable law or regulation or in connection with the termination and liquidation of the Trust. The Sponsor will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The quantity of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to be delivered to the Sponsor or other relevant payee in payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee or any Additional Trust Expenses, or sold to permit payment of Additional Trust Expenses, will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust&#8217;s expenses and the value of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency held by the Trust. See &#8220;&#8212;Expenses; Sales of Bitcoin.&#8221; Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each delivery or sale of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency by the Trust for the payment of expenses will be a taxable event to shareholders. See &#8220;&#8212; Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences&#8212;Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Hypothetical Expense Example </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following table illustrates the anticipated impact of the payment of the Trust&#8217;s expenses on the number of Bitcoins represented by each outstanding Share for three years, assuming that the Trust does not make any payments using any Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency. It assumes that the only transfers of Bitcoins will be those needed to pay the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and that the price of Bitcoins and the number of Shares remain constant during the three-year period covered. The table does not show the impact of any Additional Trust Expenses. Any Additional Trust Expenses, if and when incurred, will accelerate the decrease in the fractional number of Bitcoins represented by each Share. In addition, the table does not show the effect of any waivers of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee that may be in effect from time to time. </p>

Rather, the general fiduciary duties that would apply to the Sponsor are defined and limited in scope by the Trust Agreement. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under Delaware law, a shareholder may bring a derivative action if the shareholder is a shareholder at the time the action is brought and either (i)&#160;was a shareholder at the time of the transaction at issue or (ii)&#160;acquired the status of shareholder by operation of law or the Trust&#8217;s governing instrument from a person who was a shareholder at the time of the transaction at issue. Additionally, Section&#160;3816(e) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act specifically provides that &#8220;a beneficial owner&#8217;s right to bring a derivative action may be subject to such additional standards and restrictions, if any, as are set forth in the governing instrument of the statutory trust, including, without limitation, the requirement that beneficial owners owning a specified beneficial interest in the statutory trust join in the bringing of the derivative action.&#8221; In addition to the requirements of applicable law, the Trust Agreement provides that no shareholder will have the right, power or authority to bring or maintain a derivative action, suit or other proceeding on behalf of the Trust unless two or more shareholders who (i)&#160;are not &#8220;Affiliates&#8221; (as defined in the Trust Agreement and below) of one another and (ii)&#160;collectively hold at least 10.0% of the outstanding Shares join in the bringing or maintaining of such action, suit or other proceeding. The Trust selected the 10.0% ownership threshold because the Trust believed that this was a threshold that investors would be comfortable with based on market precedent. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This provision applies to any derivative action brought in the name of the Trust other than claims brought under the federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder, to which Section&#160;7.4 does not apply. Due to this additional requirement, a shareholder attempting to bring a derivative action in the name of the Trust will be required to locate other shareholders with which it is not affiliated and that have sufficient Shares to meet the 10.0% threshold based on the number of Shares outstanding on the date the claim is brought and thereafter throughout the duration of the action, suit or proceeding. </p>

Shareholders may determine the total number of Shares outstanding by reviewing the Trust&#8217;s annual filings on Form 10-K, quarterly filings on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K reporting sales of unregistered securities pursuant to Item&#160;3.02 thereof, or by requesting the number of Shares outstanding at any time from the Sponsor pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 8.1 of the Trust Agreement and Section&#160;3819(a) of the DSTA. Because the Trust is a grantor trust, it may only issue one class of securities, the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust offers Shares on a periodic basis at such times and for such periods as the Sponsor determines in its sole discretion. As a result, in order to maintain the 10.0% ownership threshold required to maintain a derivative action, shareholders may need to increase their holdings or locate additional shareholders during the pendency of a claim. The Trust posts the number of Shares outstanding as of the end of each month on its website and as of the end of each quarter in its annual and quarterly filings with the SEC. The Trust additionally reports sales of unregistered securities on Form 8-K pursuant to Item&#160;3.02 thereof. Shareholders may monitor the number of Shares outstanding at any time for purposes of calculating their ownership threshold by reviewing the Trust&#8217;s website and SEC filings and by requesting the number of Shares outstanding on any date from the Sponsor at any time pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 8.1 of the Trust Agreement. Shareholders have the opportunity at any time to increase their holdings or locate other shareholders to maintain the 10.0% threshold throughout the duration of a derivative claim. Shareholders may do so by contacting shareholders that are required to file Schedule 13Ds or Schedule 13Gs with the SEC or by requesting from the Sponsor the list of the names and last known address of all shareholders pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 8.1 of the Trust Agreement and Section&#160;3819(a) of the DSTA. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor is not aware of any reason to believe that Section&#160;7.4 of the Trust Agreement is not enforceable under state or federal law. The Court of Chancery of Delaware has stated that &#8220;[t]he DSTA is enabling in nature and, as such, permits a trust through its declarations of trust to delineate additional standards and requirements with which a stockholder-plaintiff must comply to proceed derivatively in the name of the trust.&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">Hartsel v. Vanguard Group., Inc.,</span> Del. Ch. June&#160;15, 2011. However, there is limited case law addressing the enforceability of provisions like Section&#160;7.4 under state and federal law and it is possible that this provision would not be enforced by a court in another jurisdiction or under other circumstances. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beneficial owners may have the right, subject to certain legal requirements, to bring class actions in federal court to enforce their rights under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC. Beneficial owners who have suffered losses in connection with the purchase or sale of their beneficial interests may be able to recover such losses from the Sponsor where the losses result from a violation by the Sponsor of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Actions Taken to Protect the Trust </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor may prosecute, defend, settle or compromise actions or claims at law or in equity that it considers necessary or proper to protect the Trust or the interests of the shareholders. The expenses incurred by the Sponsor in connection therewith (including the fees and disbursements of legal counsel) will be expenses of the Trust and are deemed to be Additional Trust Expenses. The Sponsor will be entitled to be reimbursed for the Additional Trust Expenses it pays on behalf of the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Successor Sponsors </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Sponsor is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, the Trust may dissolve and a Liquidating Trustee may be appointed to terminate and liquidate the Trust and distribute its remaining assets. The Trustee will have no obligation to appoint a successor sponsor or to assume the duties of the Sponsor, and will have no liability to any person because the Trust is or is not terminated. However, if a certificate of dissolution or revocation of the Sponsor&#8217;s charter is filed (and ninety (90)&#160;days have passed after the date of notice to the Sponsor of revocation without a reinstatement of the Sponsor&#8217;s charter) or the withdrawal, removal, adjudication or admission of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Sponsor has occurred, shareholders holding at least a majority (over 50%) of the Shares may agree in writing to continue the affairs of the Trust and to select, effective as of the date of such event, one or more successor Sponsors within ninety (90)&#160;days of any such event. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Trustee </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trustee is a fiduciary under the Trust Agreement and must satisfy the requirements of Section&#160;3807 of the Delaware Trust Statute.

The Trustee is appointed to serve as the trustee for the sole purpose of satisfying Section&#160;3807(a) of the DSTA which requires that the Trust have at least one trustee with a principal place of business in the State of Delaware. The duties of the Trustee are limited to (i)&#160;accepting legal process served on the Trust in the State of Delaware and (ii) the execution of any certificates required to be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State which the Trustee is required to execute under the DSTA. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent the Trustee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities to the Trust or the shareholders under the DSTA, such duties and liabilities will be replaced by the duties and liabilities of the Trustee expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will have no obligation to supervise, nor will it be liable for, the acts or omissions of the Sponsor, Transfer Agent, Custodian or any other person. Neither the Trustee, either in its capacity as trustee or in its individual capacity, nor any director, officer or controlling person of the Trustee is, or has any liability as, the issuer, director, officer or controlling person of the issuer of Shares. The Trustee&#8217;s liability is limited solely to the express obligations of the Trustee as set forth in the Trust Agreement. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor has the exclusive management, authority and control of all aspects of the activities of the Trust. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Sponsor, nor does the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Sponsor. The existence of a trustee should not be taken as an indication of any additional level of management or supervision over the Trust. The Trust Agreement provides that the management authority with respect to the Trust is vested directly in the Sponsor and that the Trustee is not responsible or liable for the genuineness, enforceability, collectability, value, sufficiency, location or existence of any of the Bitcoins or other assets of the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Possible Repayment of Distributions Received by Shareholders; Indemnification by Shareholders </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Shares are limited liability investments. Investors may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their investment. Although it is unlikely, the Sponsor may, from time to time, make distributions to the shareholders. However, shareholders could be required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of the Trust any distribution they received at a time when the Trust was in fact insolvent or in violation of its Trust Agreement. In addition, the Trust Agreement provides that shareholders will indemnify the Trust for any harm suffered by it as a result of shareholders&#8217; actions unrelated to the activities of the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing repayment of distributions and indemnity provisions (other than the provision for shareholders indemnifying the Trust for taxes imposed upon it by a state, local or foreign taxing authority, which is included only as a formality due to the fact that many states do not have statutory trust statutes therefore the tax status of the Trust in such states might, theoretically, be challenged) are commonplace in statutory trusts and limited partnerships. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Indemnification of the Trustee </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trustee and any of the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Trustee will be indemnified by the Trust as primary obligor and Digital Currency Group, Inc. as secondary obligor and held harmless against any loss, damage, liability, claim, action, suit, cost, expense, disbursement (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), tax or penalty of any kind and nature whatsoever, arising out of, imposed upon or asserted at any time against such indemnified person in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Trust Agreement, the creation, operation or termination of the Trust or the transactions contemplated therein; provided, however, that neither the Trust nor Digital Currency Group, Inc. will be required to indemnify any such indemnified person for any such expenses which are a result of the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such indemnified person. If the Trust has insufficient assets or improperly refuses to pay such an indemnified person within 60 days of a request for payment owed under the Trust Agreement, Digital Currency Group, Inc. will, as secondary obligor, compensate or reimburse the Trustee or indemnify, defend and hold harmless such an indemnified person as if it were the primary obligor under the Trust Agreement. Any amount payable to such an indemnified person under the Trust Agreement may be payable in advance under certain circumstances and will be secured by a lien on the Trust property. The obligations of Digital Currency Group, Inc. and the Trust to indemnify such indemnified persons under the Trust Agreement will survive the termination of the Trust Agreement. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><span style="font-style:italic">Holding of Trust Property </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust will hold and record the ownership of the Trust&#8217;s assets in a manner such that it will be owned for the benefit of the shareholders for the purposes of, and subject to and limited by the terms and conditions set forth in, the Trust Agreement.

However, the Sponsor may not make an amendment, or otherwise supplement the Trust Agreement, if such amendment or supplement would permit the Sponsor, the Trustee or any other person to vary the investment of the shareholders (within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations) or would otherwise adversely affect the status of the Trust as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, no amendments to the Trust Agreement that materially adversely affect the interests of shareholders may be made without the vote of at least a majority (over 50%) of the Shares (not including any Shares held by the Sponsor or its affiliates).

The Custodian requires written approval of the Trust prior to changing the location of the private key shards, and therefore the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, to a location outside of the United States.

Under the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian represents and warrants that it has no right, interest, or title in the Bitcoin held in the Digital Asset Account, and agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, lend, pledge, hypothecate or rehypothecate such digital assets.

In addition, if the Trust or the Sponsor is unable to timely withdraw Bitcoin from the Digital Asset Account due to the Custodian&#8217;s systems being offline or otherwise unavailable for a period of 48 hours or more, the Custodian will use its best efforts to provide the Sponsor and the Trust with an amount of Bitcoin that is equivalent to any pending withdrawal amounts in order to permit the Sponsor and the Trust to carry on processing withdrawals. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Custodian&#8217;s or Trust&#8217;s total liability under the Custodian Agreement will never exceed the value of the Bitcoin on deposit in the Digital Asset Account at the time of, and directly relating to, the events giving rise to the liability occurred, the value of which will be determined in accordance with the Custodian Agreement. In addition, for as long as a cold storage address holds Bitcoin with a value in excess of $100 million (the &#8220;Cold Storage Threshold&#8221;) for a period of five consecutive business days or more without being reduced to the Cold Storage Threshold or lower, the Custodian&#8217;s maximum liability for such cold storage address shall be limited to the Cold Storage Threshold. The Sponsor monitors the value of Bitcoins deposited in cold storage addresses for whether the Cold Storage Threshold has been met by determining the U.S. dollar value of Bitcoins deposited in each cold storage address on business days. Although the Cold Storage Threshold has never been met for a given cold storage address, to the extent it is met and not reduced within five business days, the Trust would not have a claim against the Custodian with respect to the digital assets held in such address to the extent the value exceeds the Cold Storage Threshold. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Custodian or Trust are not liable to each other for any lost profits or any special, incidental, indirect, intangible, or consequential damages, whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not the Custodian has been advised of such losses or the Custodian knew or should have known of the possibility of such damages. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Custodian is not liable for delays, suspension of operations, whether temporary or permanent, failure in performance, or interruption of service which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond the reasonable control of the Custodian, including but not limited to, any delay or failure due to any act of God, natural disasters, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorists, including but not limited to cyber-related terrorist acts, hacking, government restrictions, exchange or market rulings, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other catastrophe or any other occurrence which is beyond the reasonable control of the Custodian and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

For the avoidance of doubt, this summary does not discuss any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. Shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisers about the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Tax Treatment of the Trust </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor intends to take the position that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Rather, if the Trust is a grantor trust, each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated as directly owning its <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata </span>share of the Trust&#8217;s assets and a <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata </span>portion of the Trust&#8217;s income, gain, losses and deductions will &#8220;flow through&#8221; to each beneficial owner of Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust has taken certain positions with respect to the tax consequences of Incidental Rights and its receipt of IR Virtual Currency. If the IRS were to disagree with, and successfully challenge, any of these positions, the Trust might not qualify as a grantor trust. In addition, the Sponsor has delivered the Pre-Creation Abandonment Notices to the former custodian and the Custodian, stating that the Trust is irrevocably abandoning, effective immediately prior to each Creation Time, all Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to which it would otherwise be entitled as of such time and with respect to which it has not taken any Affirmative Action at or prior to such time. The Trust has also abandoned Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency through Affirmative Actions. There can be no complete assurance that these abandonments will be treated as effective for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Trust were treated as owning any asset other than Bitcoins as of any date on which it creates Shares, it would likely cease to qualify as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the evolving nature of digital assets, it is not possible to predict potential future developments that may arise with respect to digital assets, including forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences. Assuming that the Trust is currently a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain future developments could render it impossible, or impracticable, for the Trust to continue to be treated as a grantor trust for such purposes. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Trust is not properly classified as a grantor trust, the Trust might be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, due to the uncertain treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance in this regard. If the Trust were classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax consequences of owning Shares generally would not be materially different from the tax consequences described herein, although there might be certain differences, including with respect to timing of the recognition of taxable income or loss. In addition, tax information reports provided to beneficial owners of Shares would be made in a different form. If the Trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be classified as a corporation for such purposes. In that event, the Trust would be subject to entity-level U.S. federal income tax (currently at the rate of 21%) on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trust&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Any such dividend distributed to a beneficial owner of Shares that is a non-U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as provided in an applicable tax treaty). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The remainder of this discussion is based on the assumption that the Trust will be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Uncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Digital Assets </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of an undivided interest in the Bitcoins (and any Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency) held in the Trust. Due to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and the absence of comprehensive guidance with respect to digital assets, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets are uncertain. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) released a notice (the &#8220;Notice&#8221;) discussing certain aspects of the treatment of &#8220;convertible virtual currency&#8221; (that is, digital assets that have an equivalent value in fiat currency or that act as substitutes for fiat currency) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the Notice, the IRS stated that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such digital assets (i)&#160;are &#8220;property,&#8221; (ii)&#160;are not &#8220;currency&#8221; for purposes of the provisions of the Code relating to foreign currency gain or loss and (iii)&#160;may be held as a capital asset. In 2019, the IRS released a revenue ruling and a set of &#8220;Frequently Asked Questions&#8221; (the &#8220;Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs&#8221;) that provide some additional guidance, including guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital assets are taxable events giving rise to ordinary income and guidance with respect to the determination of the tax basis of digital assets. However, the Notice and the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs do not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets. Moreover, although the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs address the treatment of hard forks, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of the income inclusions. While the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs do not address most situations in which airdrops occur, it is clear from the reasoning of the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs that the IRS generally would treat an airdrop as a taxable event giving rise to ordinary income. </p>

It is also unclear what additional guidance on the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be issued in the future. Any such alteration of the current IRS positions or additional guidance could result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders and could have an adverse effect on the prices of digital assets, including the price of Bitcoin in the Digital Asset Market, and therefore could have an adverse effect on the value of Shares. Future developments that may arise with respect to digital assets may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, the Notice addresses only digital assets that are &#8220;convertible virtual currency,&#8221; and it is conceivable that, as a result of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence, a Trust will hold certain types of digital assets that are not within the scope of the Notice. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The remainder of this discussion assumes that Bitcoin, and any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency that the Trust may hold, is properly treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as property that may be held as a capital asset and that is not currency for purposes of the provisions of the Code relating to foreign currency gain and loss. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the Trust and in digital assets in general, including, in the case of shareholders that are generally exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, whether such shareholders may recognize &#8220;unrelated business taxable income&#8221; (&#8220;UBTI&#8221;) as a consequence of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is possible that, in the future, the Trust will hold Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency that it receives in connection with its investment in Bitcoins. The uncertainties with respect to the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes, described above, apply to Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency, as well as to Bitcoins. As described above, the Notice addressed only digital assets that are &#8220;convertible virtual currency,&#8221; defined as digital assets that have an equivalent value in fiat currency or that act as substitutes for fiat currency. It is conceivable that certain IR Virtual Currency the Trust may receive in the future would not be within the scope of the Notice. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, it is expected that the Trust would receive Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency as a consequence of a fork, an airdrop or a similar occurrence related to its ownership of Bitcoins. As described above, the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs include guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, forks (and, presumably, airdrops) of digital assets are taxable events giving rise to ordinary income, but there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of the income inclusions. The Trust&#8217;s receipt of Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency may give rise to other tax issues. The possibility that the Trust will receive Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency thus increases the uncertainties and risks with respect to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust may distribute Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, or cash from the sale of Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, to the shareholders. Alternatively, the Trust may form a liquidating trust to which it contributes Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency and distribute interests in the liquidating trust to the shareholders. Any such distribution will not be a taxable event for a U.S. Holder (as defined below). A U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency distributed, whether directly or through the medium of a liquidating trust, will be the same as the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in the distributed assets immediately prior to the distribution, and the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in its <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata </span>share of the Trust&#8217;s remaining assets will not include the amount of such basis. Immediately after any such distribution, the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period with respect to the distributed Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency will be the same as the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period with respect to the distributed assets immediately prior to the distribution. A subsequent sale of the distributed Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency will generally be a taxable event for a U.S. Holder. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For simplicity of presentation, the remainder of this discussion assumes that the Trust will hold only Bitcoins. However, the principles set forth in the discussion below apply to all of the assets that the Trust may hold at any time, including Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency, as well as Bitcoins. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each beneficial owner of Shares generally will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning an undivided interest in any Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency held in the Trust, and any transfers or sales of Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency by the Trust (other than distributions by the Trust, as described in the preceding paragraph) will be taxable events to shareholders with respect to which shareholders will generally recognize gain or loss in a manner similar to the recognition of gain or loss on a taxable disposition of Bitcoins, as described below. </p>

Assuming that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such a contribution should not be a taxable event to the U.S. Holder. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each U.S. Holder will be treated as owning an undivided interest in the Bitcoins held in the Trust and will be treated as directly realizing its pro rata share of the Trust&#8217;s income, gains, losses and deductions. When a U.S. Holder purchases Shares solely for cash, (i)&#160;the U.S. Holder&#8217;s initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the Bitcoins held in the Trust will be equal to the amount paid for the Shares and (ii)&#160;the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for its pro rata share of such Bitcoins will begin on the date of such purchase. When a U.S. Holder acquires Shares in exchange for Bitcoins, (i)&#160;the U.S. Holder&#8217;s initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the Bitcoins held in the Trust will be equal to the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis in the Bitcoins that the U.S. Holder transferred to the Trust and (ii)&#160;the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for its pro rata share of such Bitcoins generally will include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the Bitcoins that the U.S. Holder transferred to the Trust. The Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs confirm that if a taxpayer acquires tokens of a digital asset at different times and for different prices, the taxpayer has a separate tax basis in each lot of such tokens. Under the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs, if a U.S. Holder that owns more than one lot of Bitcoins contributes a portion of its Bitcoins to the Trust in exchange for Shares, the U.S. Holder may designate the lot(s) from which such contribution will be made, provided that the U.S. Holder is able to identify specifically which Bitcoins it is contributing and to substantiate its tax basis in those Bitcoins. In general, if a U.S. Holder acquires Shares (i)&#160;solely for cash at different prices, (ii)&#160;partly for cash and partly in exchange for a contribution of Bitcoins or (iii)&#160;in exchange for a contribution of Bitcoins with different tax bases, the U.S. Holder&#8217;s share of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins will consist of separate lots with separate tax bases. In addition, in this situation, the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for the separate lots may be different.

As a result, each U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i)&#160;the fair market value of the U.S. Holder&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata </span>share of the Bitcoins transferred and (ii)&#160;the U.S. Holder&#8217;s tax basis for its <span style="font-style:italic">pro rata </span>share of the Bitcoins transferred.

Under the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs, a U.S. Holder will have a basis in any IR Virtual Currency received in a fork or airdrop equal to the amount of income the U.S. Holder recognizes as a result of such fork or airdrop and the U.S. Holder&#8217;s holding period for such IR Virtual Currency will begin as of the time it recognizes such income. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">U.S. Holders&#8217;<span style="font-style:italic"> pro rata</span> shares of the expenses incurred by the Trust will be treated as &#8220;miscellaneous itemized deductions&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

For taxable years beginning on or after January&#160;1, 2026, a non-corporate U.S. Holder&#8217;s share of these expenses will be deductible for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes only to the extent that the U.S. Holder&#8217;s share of the expenses, when combined with other &#8220;miscellaneous itemized deductions,&#8221; exceeds 2% of the U.S. Holder&#8217;s adjusted gross income for the particular year, will not be deductible for U.S. federal alternative minimum tax purposes and will be subject to certain other limitations on deductibility. </p>

Although there is no guidance on point, it is likely that any ordinary income recognized by a non-U.S. Holder as a result of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence would constitute FDAP income. It is unclear, however, whether any such FDAP income would be properly treated as U.S.- source or foreign-source FDAP income.

If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden). Shareholders should consult their tax advisers regarding the effects of FATCA on an investment in the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold;text-align:center">ERISA AND RELATED CONSIDERATIONS </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following section sets forth certain consequences under ERISA and the Code which a fiduciary of an &#8220;employee benefit plan&#8221; as defined in and subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA, or of a &#8220;plan&#8221; as defined in and subject to Section&#160;4975 of the Code, who has investment discretion should consider before deciding to acquire Shares with plan assets (such &#8220;employee benefit plans&#8221; and &#8220;plans&#8221; being referred to herein as &#8220;Plans,&#8221; and such fiduciaries with investment discretion being referred to herein as &#8220;Plan Fiduciaries&#8221;). The following summary is not intended to be complete, but only to address certain questions under ERISA and the Code that are likely to be raised by the Plan Fiduciary&#8217;s own counsel. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;text-align:center">* * * </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, the terms &#8220;employee benefit plan&#8221; as defined in ERISA and &#8220;plan&#8221; as defined in Section&#160;4975 of the Code together refer to any plan or account of various types which provides retirement benefits or welfare benefits to an individual or to an employer&#8217;s employees and their beneficiaries. Such plans and accounts include, but are not limited to, corporate pension and profit sharing plans, &#8220;simplified employee pension plans,&#8221; Keogh plans for self-employed individuals (including partners), individual retirement accounts described in Section&#160;408 of the Code and medical benefit plans. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each Plan Fiduciary must give appropriate consideration to the facts and circumstances that are relevant to an investment in the Trust, including the role an investment in the Trust plays in the Plan&#8217;s investment portfolio. Each Plan Fiduciary must be satisfied that investment in the Trust is a prudent investment for the Plan, that the investments of the Plan, including the investment in the Trust, are diversified so as to minimize the risks of large losses and that an investment in the Trust complies with the documents of the Plan and related trust and that an investment in the Trust does not give rise to a transaction prohibited by Section&#160;406 of ERISA or Section&#160;4975 of the Code. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while generally not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section&#160;4975 of the Code, may be subject to provisions under other U.S. or non-U.S federal, state, local or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code. Fiduciaries of such plans should consider the consequences of an investment in the Trust under any such applicable similar laws or regulations before acquiring any Shares. </p>

Those rules provide that the assets of an entity will not be deemed &#8220;plan assets&#8221; of a Plan that purchases an interest therein if the investment in the entity by all &#8220;benefit plan investors&#8221; is not &#8220;significant&#8221; or certain other exceptions apply. The term &#8220;benefit plan investors&#8221; includes all Plans (<span style="font-style:italic">i.e.</span>, all &#8220;employee benefit plans&#8221; as defined in and subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and all &#8220;plans&#8221; as defined in and subject to Section&#160;4975 of the Code) and all entities that hold &#8220;plan assets&#8221; (each, a &#8220;Plan Assets Entity&#8221;) due to investments made in such entities by already described benefit plan investors. ERISA provides that a Plan Assets Entity is considered to hold plan assets only to the extent of the percentage of the Plan Assets Entity&#8217;s equity interests held by benefit plan investors. In addition, all or part of an investment made by an insurance company using assets from its general account may be treated as a benefit plan investor. Investments by benefit plan investors will be deemed not significant if benefit plan investors own, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the total value of each class of equity interests of the entity (determined by not including the investments of persons with discretionary authority or control over the assets of such entity, of any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, and &#8220;affiliates&#8221; (as defined in the regulations issued under ERISA) of such persons; provided, however, that under no circumstances are investments by benefit plan investors excluded from such calculation). </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to avoid causing assets of the Trust to be &#8220;plan assets,&#8221; the Sponsor intends to restrict the aggregate investment by &#8220;benefit plan investors&#8221; to under 25% of the total value of the Shares of the Trust (not including the investments of the Trustee, the Sponsor, the distributor, any other person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to the assets of the Trust, any other person who has discretionary authority or control over the assets of the Trust, and any entity (other than a benefit plan investor) that is directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of such entities (including a partnership or other entity for which the Sponsor is the general partner, managing member, investment adviser or provides investment advice), and each of the principals, officers, and employees of any of the foregoing entities who has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of such entity or the Trust). Furthermore, because the 25% test is ongoing, it not only restricts additional investments by benefit plan investors, but also can cause the Sponsor to require that existing benefit plan investors redeem from the Trust in the event that other investors redeem their Shares. If rejection of subscriptions or such compulsory redemptions are necessary, as determined by the Sponsor, to avoid causing the assets of the Trust to be &#8220;plan assets,&#8221; the Sponsor will effect such rejections or redemptions in such manner as the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, determines. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Ineligible Purchasers </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, Shares may not be purchased with the assets of a Plan if the Trustee, the Sponsor, the distributor, any placement agent, any of their respective affiliates or any of their respective employees either: (i)&#160;has investment discretion with respect to the investment of such Plan assets; (ii)&#160;has authority or responsibility to give or regularly gives investment advice with respect to such Plan assets, for a fee, and pursuant to an agreement or understanding that such advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with respect to such Plan assets and that such advice will be based on the particular investment needs of the Plan; or (iii)&#160;is an employer maintaining or contributing to such Plan. A party that is described in clause (i)&#160;or (ii)&#160;of the preceding sentence is a fiduciary under ERISA and the Code with respect to the Plan, and any such purchase (as described in clause (i), (ii)&#160;or (iii)) could result in a &#8220;prohibited transaction&#8221; under ERISA and the Code. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Except as otherwise set forth, the foregoing statements regarding the consequences under ERISA and the Code of an investment in the Trust are based on the provisions of ERISA and the Code as currently in effect, and the existing administrative and judicial interpretations thereunder. No assurance can be given that administrative, judicial or legislative changes will not occur that may make the foregoing statements incorrect or incomplete. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ACCEPTANCE OF SUBSCRIPTIONS ON BEHALF OF PLANS IS IN NO RESPECT A REPRESENTATION BY THE SPONSOR OR ANY OTHER PARTY RELATED TO THE TRUST THAT THIS INVESTMENT MEETS THE RELEVANT LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS BY ANY PARTICULAR PLAN, PLANS GENERALLY OR THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR ANY PARTICULAR PLAN OR PLANS GENERALLY.

These drawdowns notwithstanding, digital asset prices, including Bitcoin, increased significantly again during 2019, decreased significantly again in the first quarter of 2020 amidst broader market declines as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak and increased significantly again over the remainder of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.

In particular, digital asset prices have experienced extreme volatility since November 2022 when FTX halted customer withdrawals.

As a result, there may be a lack of consensus or clarity on the governance of any particular decentralized digital asset network, which may stymie such network&#8217;s utility and ability to grow and face challenges. The foregoing notwithstanding, the protocols for some decentralized networks, such as the Bitcoin Network, are informally managed by a group of core developers that propose amendments to the relevant network&#8217;s source code. Core developers&#8217; roles evolve over time, largely based on self-determined participation. If a significant majority of users and miners adopt amendments to a decentralized network based on the proposals of such core developers, such network will be subject to new protocols that may adversely affect the value of the relevant digital asset. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the foregoing, it may be difficult to find solutions or marshal sufficient effort to overcome any future problems, especially long-term problems, on digital asset networks. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Digital asset networks face significant scaling challenges and efforts to increase the volume and speed of transactions may not be successful. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many digital asset networks face significant scaling challenges due to the fact that public blockchains generally face a tradeoff between security and scalability. One means through which public blockchains achieve security is decentralization, meaning that no intermediary is responsible for securing and maintaining these systems. For example, a greater degree of decentralization generally means a given digital asset network is less susceptible to manipulation or capture. In practice, this typically means that every single node on a given digital asset network is responsible for securing the system by processing every transaction and maintaining a copy of the entire state of the network. As a result, a digital asset network may be limited in the number of transactions it can process by the capabilities of each single fully participating node. Many developers are actively researching and testing scalability solutions for public blockchains that do not necessarily result in lower levels of security or decentralization, such as off-chain payment channels and sharding. Off-chain payment channels would allow parties to transact without requiring the full processing power of a blockchain. Sharding can increase the scalability of a database, such as a blockchain, by splitting the data processing responsibility among many nodes, allowing for parallel processing and validating of transactions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&#160;31, 2022, the Bitcoin Network handled approximately three transactions per second. In an effort to increase the volume of transactions that can be processed on a given digital asset network, many digital assets are being upgraded with various features to increase the speed and throughput of digital asset transactions. For example, in August 2017, the Bitcoin network was upgraded with a technical feature known as &#8220;Segregated Witness&#8221; that potentially doubles the transactions per second that can be handled on-chain. More importantly, Segregated Witness also enables so-called second layer solutions, such as the Lightning Network, or payment channels that greatly increase transaction throughput (i.e., millions of transactions per second). Wallets and &#8220;intermediaries,&#8221; or connecting nodes that facilitate payment channels, that support Segregated Witness or Lightning Network-like technologies have not seen wide-scale use as of December&#160;31, 2022. Additionally, questions remain regarding Lightning Network services, such as its cost and who will serve as intermediaries. </p>

For example, the Bitcoin Network has been, at times, at capacity, which has led to increased transaction fees. Since January&#160;1, 2020, Bitcoin transaction fees have increased from $0.28 per Bitcoin transaction, on average, to a high of $60.95 per transaction, on average, on April&#160;20, 2021. As of December&#160;31, 2022, Bitcoin transaction fees stood at $0.83 per transaction, on average.

Following the rumor, the price of ETH decreased approximately 20% before recovering after Buterin himself dispelled the rumor. Some have speculated that the rumor led to the decrease in the price of ETH. In the event a high-profile contributor to the Bitcoin Network is perceived as no longer able to contribute to the Bitcoin Network due to death, retirement, withdrawal, incapacity, or otherwise, whether or not such perception is valid, it could negatively affect the price of Bitcoin, which could adversely impact the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Digital assets may have concentrated ownership and large sales or distributions by holders of such digital assets could have an adverse effect on the market price of such digital asset. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&#160;31, 2022, the largest 100 Bitcoin wallets held approximately 15% of the Bitcoins in circulation.

The malicious actor or botnet could also control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions. Although the malicious actor or botnet would not be able to generate new tokens or transactions using such control, it could &#8220;double-spend&#8221; its own tokens (i.e., spend the same tokens in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users&#8217; transactions for so long as it maintained control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network or the Bitcoin community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the Blockchain may not be possible. Further, a malicious actor or botnet could create a flood of transactions in order to slow down the Bitcoin Network. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, in August 2020, the Ethereum Classic Network was the target of two double-spend attacks by an unknown actor or actors that gained more than 50% of the processing power of the Ethereum Classic Network. The attack resulted in reorganizations of the Ethereum Classic Blockchain that allowed the attacker or attackers to reverse previously recorded transactions in excess of over $5.0 million and $1.0 million. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in May 2019, the Bitcoin Cash network experienced a 51% attack when two large mining pools reversed a series of transactions in order to stop an unknown miner from taking advantage of a flaw in a recent Bitcoin Cash protocol upgrade. Although this particular attack was arguably benevolent, the fact that such coordinated activity was able to occur may negatively impact perceptions of the Bitcoin Cash Network.

The possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of Bitcoin transactions, and this risk is heightened if over 50% of the processing power on the network falls within the jurisdiction of a single governmental authority. If network participants, including the core developers and the administrators of mining pools, do not act to ensure greater decentralization of Bitcoin mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network will increase, which may adversely affect the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A malicious actor may also obtain control over the Bitcoin Network through its influence over core developers by gaining direct control over a core developer or an otherwise influential programmer.

However, if less than a substantial majority of users and miners&#8217; consent to the proposed modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a &#8220;hard fork&#8221; of the Bitcoin Network, with one group running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of Bitcoin running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability. For example, in August 2017, Bitcoin &#8220;forked&#8221; into Bitcoin and a new digital asset, Bitcoin Cash, as a result of a several-year dispute over how to increase the rate of transactions that the Bitcoin Network can process.

otherwise compatible software that users run. Such a fork could lead to users and miners abandoning the digital asset with the flawed software. It is possible, however, that a substantial number of users and miners could adopt an incompatible version of the digital asset while resisting community-led efforts to merge the two chains. This could result in a permanent fork. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Forks may also occur as a network community&#8217;s response to a significant security breach. For example, in July 2016, Ethereum &#8220;forked&#8221; into Ethereum and a new digital asset, Ethereum Classic, as a result of the Ethereum network community&#8217;s response to a significant security breach. In June 2016, an anonymous hacker exploited a smart contract running on the Ethereum network to syphon approximately $60&#160;million of ETH held by The DAO, a distributed autonomous organization, into a segregated account. In response to the hack, most participants in the Ethereum community elected to adopt a &#8220;fork&#8221; that effectively reversed the hack. However, a minority of users continued to develop the original blockchain, referred to as &#8220;Ethereum Classic&#8221; with the digital asset on that blockchain now referred to as ETC. ETC now trades on several Digital Asset Exchanges. A fork may also occur as a result of an unintentional or unanticipated software flaw in the various versions of otherwise compatible software that users run. Such a fork could lead to users and miners abandoning the digital asset with the flawed software. It is possible, however, that a substantial number of users and miners could adopt an incompatible version of the digital asset while resisting community-led efforts to merge the two chains. This could result in a permanent fork, as in the case of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, many developers have previously initiated hard forks in the Blockchain to launch new digital assets, such as Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Silver and Bitcoin Diamond. To the extent such digital assets compete with Bitcoin, such competition could impact demand for Bitcoin and could adversely impact the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, a hard fork can lead to new security concerns. For example, when the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks, two other digital asset networks, split in July 2016, replay attacks, in which transactions from one network were rebroadcast to nefarious effect on the other network, plagued Ethereum exchanges through at least October 2016. An Ethereum exchange announced in July 2016 that it had lost 40,000 Ethereum Classic, worth about $100,000 at that time, as a result of replay attacks. Similar replay attack concerns occurred in connection with the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi&#8217;s Vision networks split in November 2018. Another possible result of a hard fork is an inherent decrease in the level of security due to significant amounts of mining power remaining on one network or migrating instead to the new forked network. After a hard fork, it may become easier for an individual miner or mining pool&#8217;s hashing power to exceed 50% of the processing power of a digital asset network that retained or attracted less mining power, thereby making digital assets that rely on proof-of-work more susceptible to attack. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Protocols may also be cloned. Unlike a fork, which modifies an existing blockchain, and results in two competing networks, each with the same genesis block, a &#8220;clone&#8221; is a copy of a protocol&#8217;s codebase, but results in an entirely new blockchain and new genesis block. Tokens are created solely from the new &#8220;clone&#8221; network and, in contrast to forks, holders of tokens of the existing network that was cloned do not receive any tokens of the new network. A &#8220;clone&#8221; results in a competing network that has characteristics substantially similar to the network it was based on, subject to any changes as determined by the developer(s) that initiated the clone. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A hard fork may adversely affect the price of Bitcoin at the time of announcement or adoption. For example, the announcement of a hard fork could lead to increased demand for the pre-fork digital asset, in anticipation that ownership of the pre-fork digital asset would entitle holders to a new digital asset following the fork. The increased demand for the pre-fork digital asset may cause the price of the digital asset to rise. After the hard fork, it is possible the aggregate price of the two versions of the digital asset running in parallel would be less than the price of the digital asset immediately prior to the fork. Furthermore, while the Trust would be entitled to both versions of the digital asset running in parallel, the Sponsor will, as permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, determine which version of the digital asset is generally accepted as the Bitcoin Network and should therefore be considered the appropriate network for the Trust&#8217;s purposes, and there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork. Either of these events could therefore adversely impact the value of the Shares.&#160;As an illustrative example of a digital asset hard fork, on November&#160;15, 2020, certain Bitcoin Cash developers enacted a proposed update to the Bitcoin Cash Network requiring 8% of mined tokens to be redistributed to the developer pool causing a hard fork and created a network with a token labeled BCHA. For the days following the fork, the price of BCH fluctuated from $246.15 on November&#160;15, 2020 to $256.55 on November&#160;20, 2020. A clone may also adversely affect the price of Bitcoin at the time of announcement or adoption. For example, on November&#160;6, 2016, Rhett Creighton, a Zcash developer, cloned the Zcash Network to launch Zclassic, a substantially identical version of the Zcash Network that eliminated the Founders&#8217; Reward. For the days following the date the first Zclassic block was mined, the price of ZEC fell from $504.57 on November&#160;5, 2016 to $236.01 on November&#160;7, 2016 in the midst of a broader sell off of ZEC beginning immediately after the Zcash Network launch on October&#160;28, 2016. A clone may also adversely affect the price of Bitcoin at the time of announcement or adoption. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A future fork in or clone of the Bitcoin Network could adversely affect the value of the Shares or the ability of the Trust to operate. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Shareholders may not receive the benefits of any forks or airdrops. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to forks, a digital asset may become subject to a similar occurrence known as an &#8220;airdrop.&#8221; In an airdrop, the promotors of a new digital asset announce to holders of another digital asset that such holders will be entitled to claim a certain amount of the new digital asset for free, based on the fact that they hold such other digital asset. For example, in March 2017 the promoters of Stellar Lumens announced that anyone that owned Bitcoin as of June&#160;26, 2017 could claim, until August&#160;27, 2017, a certain amount of Stellar Lumens. The Trust did not participate in the 2017 Stellar Lumen airdrop. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&#160;1, 2017, the Trust announced that it had irrevocably abandoned (i)&#160;all of the rights to Bitcoin Diamond tokens then held by the Trust as a result of the fork in the Blockchain on November&#160;24, 2017 and (ii)&#160;all of the rights to Bytether tokens then held by the Trust as a result of the fork in the Blockchain on August&#160;1, 2017. The Trust did not receive any direct or indirect consideration for the abandonment of these rights. As a consequence of the abandonment, the Trust has no right to receive any Bitcoin Diamond tokens or Bytether tokens at any point in the future, the Trust will not accept any Bitcoin Diamond tokens or Bytether tokens, or any payment in respect thereof, at any point in the future and the Trust will not otherwise take any action in the future inconsistent with such abandonment. On December&#160;29, 2017 the Sponsor of the Trust announced that it had declared a distribution and established a record date for the distribution, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January&#160;8, 2018, of the Incidental Right to the Bitcoin SegWit2X held by the Trust. On April&#160;2, 2018, Grayscale Investments, LLC, as agent of the shareholders of record on the record date of the distribution of rights to Bitcoin SegWit2X tokens, announced that it had, on behalf of such shareholders, abandoned the rights to the Bitcoin SegWit2X tokens because it determined that the costs that would be incurred by it in connection with exercising those rights and selling the Bitcoin SegWit2X tokens would exceed the gross proceeds that would be generated by such sales. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shareholders may not receive the benefits of any forks, the Trust may not choose, or be able, to participate in an airdrop, and the timing of receiving any benefits from a fork, airdrop or similar event is uncertain. We refer to the right to receive any such benefit as an &#8220;Incidental Right&#8221; and any such virtual currency acquired through an Incidental Right as &#8220;IR Virtual Currency.&#8221; There are likely to be operational, tax, securities law, regulatory, legal and practical issues that significantly limit, or prevent entirely, shareholders&#8217; ability to realize a benefit, through their Shares in the Trust, from any such Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. For instance, the Custodian may not agree to provide access to the IR Virtual Currency. In addition, the Sponsor may determine that there is no safe or practical way to custody the IR Virtual Currency, or that trying to do so may pose an unacceptable risk to the Trust&#8217;s holdings in Bitcoin, or that the costs of taking possession and/or maintaining ownership of the IR Virtual Currency exceed the benefits of owning the IR Virtual Currency. Additionally, laws, regulation or other factors may prevent shareholders from benefitting from the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency even if there is a safe and practical way to custody and secure the IR Virtual Currency. For example, it may be illegal to sell or otherwise dispose of the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency, or there may not be a suitable market into which the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency can be sold (immediately after the fork or airdrop, or ever). The Sponsor may also determine, in consultation with its legal advisers, that the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency is, or is likely to be deemed, a security under federal or state securities laws. In such a case, the Sponsor would irrevocably abandon, as of any date on which the Trust creates Shares, such Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency if holding it would have an adverse effect on the Trust and it would not be practicable to avoid such effect by disposing of the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency in a manner that would result in shareholders receiving more than insignificant value thereof. In making such a determination, the Sponsor expects to take into account a number of factors, including the various definitions of a &#8220;security&#8221; under the federal securities laws and federal court decisions interpreting elements of these definitions, such as the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s decisions in the <span style="font-style:italic">Howey </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Reves </span>cases, as well as reports, orders, press releases, public statements and speeches by the SEC and its staff providing guidance on when a digital asset may be a security for purposes of the federal securities laws. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust has informed the Custodian that it is irrevocably abandoning, as of any date on which the Trust creates Shares, any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to which it would otherwise be entitled as of such date and with respect to which it has not taken any Affirmative Action at or prior to such date. In order to avert abandonment of an Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency, the Trust will send a notice to the Custodian of its intention to retain such Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency. The Sponsor intends to evaluate each future fork or airdrop on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the Trust&#8217;s legal advisers, tax consultants and Custodian. Any inability to recognize the economic benefit of a hard fork or airdrop could adversely affect the value of the Shares. See &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin Network, the Sponsor will, if permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, use its discretion to determine which network should be considered the appropriate network for the Trust&#8217;s purposes, and in doing so may adversely affect the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin Network, the Sponsor will, as permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, use its discretion to determine, in good faith, which peer-to-peer network, among a group of incompatible forks of the Bitcoin Network, is generally accepted as the Bitcoin Network and should therefore be considered the appropriate network for the Trust&#8217;s purposes. The Sponsor will base its determination on a variety of then relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the Sponsor&#8217;s beliefs regarding expectations of the core developers of Bitcoin, users, services, businesses, miners and other constituencies, as well as the actual continued acceptance of, mining power on, and community engagement with, the Bitcoin Network. There is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork, and the Sponsor&#8217;s decision may adversely affect the value of the Shares as a result. The Sponsor may also disagree with shareholders, security vendors and the Index Provider on what is generally accepted as Bitcoin and should therefore be considered &#8220;Bitcoin&#8221; for the Trust&#8217;s purposes, which may also adversely affect the value of the Shares as a result. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Any name change and any associated rebranding initiative by the core developers of Bitcoin may not be favorably received by the digital asset community, which could negatively impact the value of Bitcoin and the value of the Shares. </span></p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From time to time, digital assets may undergo name changes and associated rebranding initiatives. For example, Bitcoin Cash may sometimes be referred to as Bitcoin ABC in an effort to differentiate itself from any Bitcoin Cash hard forks, such as Bitcoin Satoshi&#8217;s Vision, and in the third quarter of 2018, the team behind ZEN rebranded and changed the name of ZenCash to &#8220;Horizen.&#8221; We cannot predict the impact of any name change and any associated rebranding initiative on Bitcoin. After a name change and an associated rebranding initiative, a digital asset may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed by such digital asset. The failure of any name change and any associated rebranding initiative by a digital asset may result in such digital asset not realizing some or all of the anticipated benefits contemplated by the name change and associated rebranding initiative, and could negatively impact the value of Bitcoin and the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">If the Bitcoin Network is used to facilitate illicit activities, businesses that facilitate transactions in Bitcoin could be at increased risk of criminal or civil lawsuits, or of having services cut off, which could negatively affect the price of Bitcoin and the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Digital asset networks have in the past been, and may continue to be, used to facilitate illicit activities. If the Bitcoin Network is used to facilitate illicit activities, businesses that facilitate transactions in Bitcoin could be at increased risk of potential criminal or civil lawsuits, or of having banking or other services cut off, and Bitcoin could be removed from digital asset exchanges as a result of these concerns. Other service providers of such businesses may also cut off services if there is a concern that the Bitcoin Network is being used to facilitate crime. Any of the aforementioned occurrences could increase regulatory scrutiny of the Bitcoin Network and/or adversely affect the price of Bitcoin, the attractiveness of the Bitcoin Network and an investment in the Shares of the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When the Trust and the Sponsor, acting on behalf of the Trust, sell or deliver, as applicable, Bitcoin, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency, they generally do not transact directly with counterparties other than the Authorized Participant or other similarly eligible financial institutions that are subject to federal and state licensing requirements and maintain practices and policies designed to comply with AML and KYC regulations. When an Authorized Participant, or the Liquidity Provider on behalf of an Authorized Participant, sources Bitcoin in connection with the creation of the Shares or facilitates transactions in Bitcoin at the direction of the Trust or the Sponsor, it directly faces its counterparty and, in all instances, the Authorized Participant and its Liquidity Provider follow policies and procedures designed to ensure that it knows the identity of its counterparty. The Authorized Participant and the Liquidity Provider are registered broker-dealers and therefore subject to AML and countering the financing of terrorism obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act as administered by FinCEN and further overseen by the SEC and FINRA. In addition, the Liquidity Provider is a virtual currency entity licensed by the NYDFS, which additionally subjects it to AML obligations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with its regulatory obligations, the Authorized Participant, or the Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant, conducts customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence on its counterparties, which enables it to determine each counterparty&#8217;s AML and other risks and assign an appropriate risk rating. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of its counterparty onboarding process, each of the Authorized Participant and the Liquidity Provider uses third-party services to screen prospective counterparties against various watch lists, including the Specially Designated Nationals List of the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) and countries and territories identified as non-cooperative by the Financial Action Task Force. If the Sponsor, the Trust, the Authorized Participant or the Liquidity Provider were nevertheless to transact with such a sanctioned entity, the Sponsor, the Trust, the Authorized Participant and the Liquidity Provider would be at increased risk of potential criminal or civil lawsuits. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Risk Factors Related to the Digital Asset Markets </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Recent developments in the digital asset economy have led to extreme volatility and disruption in digital asset markets, a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem, significant negative publicity surrounding digital assets broadly and market-wide declines in liquidity. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing throughout 2022, digital asset prices began falling precipitously. This has led to volatility and disruption in the digital asset markets and financial difficulties for several prominent industry participants, including digital asset exchanges, hedge funds and lending platforms. For example, in the first half of 2022, digital asset lenders Celsius Network LLC and Voyager Digital Ltd. and digital asset hedge fund Three Arrows Capital each declared bankruptcy. This resulted in a loss of confidence in participants in the digital asset ecosystem, negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly and market-wide declines in digital asset trading prices and liquidity. </p> <p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

Shortly thereafter, FTX&#8217;s CEO resigned and FTX and several affiliates of FTX filed for bankruptcy. The U.S. Department of Justice subsequently brought criminal charges, including charges of fraud, violations of federal securities laws, money laundering, and campaign finance offenses, against FTX&#8217;s former CEO and others. FTX is also under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as by various regulatory authorities in the Bahamas, Europe and other jurisdictions. In response to these events, the digital asset markets have experienced extreme price volatility and declines in liquidity, and regulatory and enforcement scrutiny has increased, including from the DOJ, the SEC, the CFTC, the White House and Congress. In addition, several other entities in the digital asset industry filed for bankruptcy following FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, such as BlockFi Inc. and Genesis Global Capital, LLC, which is a subsidiary of Genesis Global Holdco, LLC (&#8220;Genesis Holdco&#8221;). The SEC also brought charges against Genesis Global Capital, LLC and Gemini Trust Company, LLC on January&#160;12, 2023 for their alleged unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Genesis Holdco, together with certain of its subsidiaries, filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in January 2023. While Genesis Holdco is not a service provider to the Trust, it is an affiliate of Genesis Global Trading, Inc., which acts as a Liquidity Provider to the Authorized Participant of the Trust, is a wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, and is an affiliate of the Trust and the Sponsor. The Liquidity Provider sources digital assets on behalf of the Authorized Participant in connection with the creation of Shares. As such, if Genesis Holdco&#8217;s bankruptcy, including the potential sale or transfer of the Liquidity Provider&#8217;s equity and/or assets as part of the bankruptcy negotiations, has a negative impact on the Liquidity Provider&#8217;s ability to act in such capacity, the Authorized Participant may be required to replace the Liquidity Provider, which could negatively impact the Trust&#8217;s ability to create new Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These events have led to significant negative publicity around digital asset market participants including DCG, Genesis and DCG&#8217;s other affiliated entities. This publicity could negatively impact the reputation of the Sponsor and have an adverse effect on the trading price and/or the value of the Shares. Moreover, sales of a significant number of Shares of the Trust as a result of these events could have a negative impact on the trading price of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These events are continuing to develop at a rapid pace and it is not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that they may pose to the Sponsor, the Trust, their affiliates and/or the Trust&#8217;s third party service providers, or on the digital asset industry as a whole. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Continued disruption and instability in the digital asset markets as these events develop, including further declines in the trading prices and liquidity of Bitcoin, could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Shares and the Shares could lose all or substantially all of their value. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The value of the Shares relates directly to the value of Bitcoins, the value of which may be highly volatile and subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the Bitcoins held by the Trust and fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin could adversely affect the value of the Shares.

In the event that the price of Bitcoin declines, the Sponsor expects the value of the Shares to decline proportionately. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The value of a Bitcoin as represented by the Index Price or by the Trust&#8217;s principal market may also be subject to momentum pricing due to speculation regarding future appreciation in value, leading to greater volatility that could adversely affect the value of the Shares. Momentum pricing typically is associated with growth stocks and other assets whose valuation, as determined by the investing public, accounts for future appreciation in value, if any. The Sponsor believes that momentum pricing of Bitcoins has resulted, and may continue to result, in speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of Bitcoin, inflating and making the Index Price more volatile. As a result, Bitcoin may be more likely to fluctuate in value due to changing investor confidence, which could impact future appreciation or depreciation in the Index Price and could adversely affect the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of Digital Asset Exchanges, they may experience fraud, business failures, security failures or operational problems, which may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and, consequently, the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Digital Asset Exchanges are relatively new and, in many ways, unregulated. While many prominent Digital Asset Exchanges provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices and regulatory compliance, many Digital Asset Exchanges do not provide this information. Furthermore, while Digital Asset Exchanges are and may continue to be subject to federal and state licensing requirements in the United States, Digital Asset Exchanges do not appear to be subject to regulation in a similar manner as other regulated trading platforms, such as national securities exchanges or designated contract markets. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in Digital Asset Exchanges, including prominent exchanges that handle a significant volume of Bitcoin trading. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many Digital Asset Exchanges are unlicensed, unregulated, operate without extensive supervision by governmental authorities, and do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management team, corporate practices, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance. In particular, those located outside the United States may be subject to significantly less stringent regulatory and compliance requirements in their local jurisdictions. As a result, trading activity on or reported by these Digital Asset Exchanges is generally significantly less regulated than trading in regulated U.S. securities and commodities markets, and may reflect behavior that would be prohibited in regulated U.S. trading venues. For example, in 2019 there were reports claiming that 80-95% of Bitcoin trading volume on Digital Asset Exchanges was false or non-economic in nature, with specific focus on unlicensed exchanges located outside of the United States. Such reports may indicate that the Digital Asset Exchange Market is significantly smaller than expected and that the U.S. makes up a significantly larger percentage of the Digital Asset Exchange Market than is commonly understood. Nonetheless, any actual or perceived false trading in the Digital Asset Exchange Market, and any other fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices, could adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and/or negatively affect the market perception of Bitcoin. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, over the past several years, some Digital Asset Exchanges have been closed, been subject to criminal and civil litigation and have entered into bankruptcy proceedings due to fraud and manipulative activity, business failure or security breaches. In many of these instances, the customers of such Digital Asset Exchanges were not compensated or made whole for the partial or complete losses of their account balances in such Digital Asset Exchanges. While smaller Digital Asset Exchanges are less likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that make larger Digital Asset Exchanges more stable, larger Digital Asset Exchanges are more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and malware and their shortcomings or ultimate failures are more likely to have contagion effects on the digital asset ecosystem, and therefore may be more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action. For example, on February&#160;7, 2014, Mt. Gox, the largest Digital Asset Exchange at the time, halted withdrawals of Bitcoin and subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan following a hack that resulted in the loss of several hundred thousand Bitcoin. In the two weeks that followed the February&#160;7, 2014 halt of Bitcoin withdrawals from Mt. Gox, the value of one Bitcoin fell on other exchanges from around $795 on February&#160;6, 2014 to $578 on February&#160;20, 2014. Failure and shortcomings of large Digital Asset Exchanges have since continued; in January 2015, Bitstamp announced that approximately 19,000 Bitcoin had been stolen from its operational or &#8220;hot&#8221; wallets and in August 2016, it was reported that almost 120,000 Bitcoins worth around $78 million were stolen from Bitfinex. The value of Bitcoin and other digital assets immediately decreased over 10% following reports of the theft at Bitfinex. Regulatory enforcement actions have followed, such as in July 2017, when FinCEN assessed a $110 million fine against BTC-E, a now defunct Digital Asset Exchange, for </p>

facilitating crimes such as drug sales and ransomware attacks. In addition, in December 2017, Yapian, the operator of Seoul-based digital asset exchange Youbit, suspended digital asset trading and filed for bankruptcy following a hack that resulted in a loss of 17% of Yapian&#8217;s assets. Following the hack, Youbit users were allowed to withdraw approximately 75% of the digital assets in their exchange accounts, with any potential further distributions to be made following Yapian&#8217;s pending bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, in January 2018, the Japanese digital asset exchange, Coincheck, was hacked, resulting in losses of approximately $535 million, and in February 2018, the Italian digital asset exchange Bitgrail, was hacked, resulting in approximately $170 million in losses. In May 2019, one of the world&#8217;s largest Digital Asset Exchanges, Binance, was hacked, resulting in losses of approximately $40 million. Most recently in November 2022, FTX, another of the world&#8217;s largest Digital Asset Exchanges, filed for bankruptcy protection. Details and events surrounding the failure are developing, but it appears that fraud, security failures and operational problems have all played a role in FTX&#8217;s issues, and it is unclear what the eventual impacts of its bankruptcy will be. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Negative perception, a lack of stability and standardized regulation in the Digital Asset Markets and the closure or temporary shutdown of Digital Asset Exchanges due to fraud, business failure, security breaches or government mandated regulation, and associated losses by customers, may reduce confidence in the Bitcoin Network and result in greater volatility in the prices of Bitcoin. Furthermore, the closure or temporary shutdown of a Digital Asset Exchange used in calculating the Index Price may result in a loss of confidence in the Trust&#8217;s ability to determine its Digital Asset Holdings on a daily basis. These potential consequences of such a Digital Asset Exchange&#8217;s failure could adversely affect the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Index has a limited history and a failure of the Index Price could adversely affect the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Index has a limited history and the Index Price is a composite reference rate calculated using volume-weighted trading price data from various Digital Asset Exchanges chosen by the Index Provider. The Digital Asset Exchanges chosen by the Index Provider have also changed over time. For example, on October&#160;29, 2022, the Index Provider removed Bitstamp from the Index due to the exchange failing the minimum liquidity requirement, and added Binance.US as a Constituent Exchange due to the exchange meeting the minimum liquidity requirement as part of its scheduled quarterly review. The Index Provider may remove or add Digital Asset Exchanges to the Index in the future at its discretion. For more information on the inclusion criteria for Digital Asset Exchanges in the Index, see &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market&#8212; Bitcoin Value&#8212;The Index and the Index Price.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although the Index is designed to accurately capture the market price of Bitcoin, third parties may be able to purchase and sell Bitcoin on public or private markets not included among the constituent Digital Asset Exchanges of the Index, and such transactions may take place at prices materially higher or lower than the Index Price. Moreover, there may be variances in the prices of Bitcoin on the various Digital Asset Exchanges, including as a result of differences in fee structures or administrative procedures on different Digital Asset Exchanges. For example, based on data provided by the Index Provider, on any given day during the year ended December&#160;31, 2022, the maximum differential between the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of any single Digital Asset Exchange included in the Index and the Index Price was 0.34% and the average of the maximum differentials of the 4:00 p.m., New York time, spot price of each Digital Asset Exchange included in the Index and the Index Price was 0.23%. During this same period, the average differential between the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot prices of all the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Index and the Index Price was 0.0002%. All Digital Asset Exchanges that were included in the Index throughout the period were considered in this analysis. To the extent such prices differ materially from the Index Price, investors may lose confidence in the Shares&#8217; ability to track the market price of Bitcoins, which could adversely affect the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Index Price used to calculate the value of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin may be volatile, and purchasing activity in the Digital Asset Markets associated with Basket creations may affect the Index Price and Share trading prices, adversely affecting the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The price of Bitcoin on public Digital Asset Exchanges has a very limited history, and during this history, Bitcoin prices on the Digital Asset Markets more generally, and on Digital Asset Exchanges individually, have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors, including operational interruptions. While the Index is designed to limit exposure to the interruption of individual Digital Asset Exchanges, the Index Price, and the price of Bitcoin generally, remains subject to volatility experienced by Digital Asset Exchanges, and such volatility could adversely affect the value of the Shares. For example, from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2022, the Index Price ranged from $3,164.99 to $67,352.59, with the straight average being $20,313.57. In addition, during the year ended December&#160;31, 2022, the Index Price ranged from $15,768.02 to $47,980.44. The Sponsor has not observed a material difference between the Index Price and average prices from the constituent Digital Asset Exchanges individually or as a group. The price of Bitcoin more generally has experienced volatility similar to the Index Price during these periods. For additional information on movement of the Index Price and the price of Bitcoin, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Historical Digital Asset Holdings and Bitcoin Prices.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, because the number of Digital Asset Exchanges is limited, the Index will necessarily be composed of a limited number of Digital Asset Exchanges. If a Digital Asset Exchange were subjected to regulatory, volatility or other pricing issues, the Index Provider would have limited ability to remove such Digital Asset Exchange from the Index, which could skew the price of Bitcoin as represented by the Index. Trading on a limited number of Digital Asset Exchanges may result in less favorable prices and decreased liquidity of Bitcoin and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Purchasing activity associated with acquiring Bitcoin required for the creation of Baskets may increase the market price of Bitcoin on the Digital Asset Markets, which will result in higher prices for the Shares. Increases in the market price of Bitcoin may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants. Other market participants may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market price of Bitcoin that may result from increased purchasing activity of Bitcoin connected with the issuance of Baskets. Consequently, the market price of Bitcoin may decline immediately after Baskets are created. Decreases in the market price of Bitcoin may also occur as a result of sales in Secondary Markets by other market participants. If the Index Price declines, the value of the Shares will generally also decline. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Competition from the emergence or growth of other digital assets or methods of investing in Bitcoin could have a negative impact on the price of Bitcoin and adversely affect the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin was the first digital asset to gain global adoption and critical mass, and as a result, it has a &#8220;first to market&#8221; advantage over other digital assets. As of December&#160;31, 2022, Bitcoin was the largest digital asset by market capitalization, as tracked by CoinMarketCap.com, and had the largest user base and largest combined mining power. Despite this first to market advantage, as of December&#160;31, 2022, there were over 22,000 alternative digital assets tracked by CoinMarketCap.com, having a total market-capitalization of approximately $661.7 billion (including the approximately $318.5 billion market cap of Bitcoin), as calculated using market prices and total available supply of each digital asset, excluding tokens pegged to other assets. In addition, many consortiums and financial institutions are also researching and investing resources into private or permissioned blockchain platforms rather than open platforms like the Bitcoin Network. Competition from the emergence or growth of alternative digital assets and smart contracts platforms, such as Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche or Cardano, could have a negative impact on the demand for, and price of, Bitcoin and thereby adversely affect the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, some digital asset networks, including the Bitcoin Network, may be the target of ill will from users of other digital asset networks. For example, Litecoin is the result of a hard fork of Bitcoin. Some users of the Bitcoin Network may harbor ill will toward the Litecoin Network, and vice versa. These users may attempt to negatively impact the use or adoption of the Bitcoin Network. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Investors may invest in Bitcoin through means other than the Shares, including through direct investments in Bitcoin and other potential financial vehicles, possibly including securities backed by or linked to Bitcoin and digital asset financial vehicles similar to the Trust. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsor&#8217;s control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in Bitcoin directly, which could limit the market for, and reduce the liquidity of, the Shares. In addition, to the extent digital asset financial vehicles other than the Trust tracking the price of Bitcoin are formed and represent a significant proportion of the demand for Bitcoin, large purchases or redemptions of the securities of these digital asset financial vehicles, or private funds holding Bitcoin, could negatively affect the Index Price, the Digital Asset Holdings, the value of the Shares, the NAV and the NAV per Share. Moreover, any reduced demand for Shares of the Trust may cause the Shares of the Trust to trade at a discount to the Digital Asset Holdings per Share. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Failure of funds that hold digital assets or that have exposure to digital assets through derivatives to receive SEC approval to list their shares on exchanges could adversely affect the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There have been a growing a number of attempts to list on national securities exchanges the shares of funds that hold digital assets or that have exposures to digital assets through derivatives. These investment vehicles attempt to provide institutional and retail investors exposure to markets for digital assets and related products. The SEC has repeatedly denied such requests. In January 2018, the SEC&#8217;s Division of Investment Management outlined several questions that sponsors would be expected to address before the SEC will consider granting approval for funds holding &#8220;substantial amounts&#8221; of cryptocurrencies or &#8220;cryptocurrency-related products.&#8221; The questions, which focus on specific requirements of the Investment Company Act, generally fall into one of five key areas: valuation, liquidity, custody, arbitrage and potential manipulation. The SEC has not explicitly stated whether each of the questions set forth would also need to be addressed by entities with similar products and investment strategies that instead pursue registered offerings under the Securities Act, although such entities would need to comply with the registration and prospectus disclosure requirements of the Securities Act. Furthermore, NYSE Arca previously withdrew the Sponsor&#8217;s application with the SEC to list the Trust on a national securities exchange. Requests to list the shares of other funds on national securities exchanges have also been submitted to the SEC. Although the SEC approved several futures-based Bitcoin ETFs in October 2021, it has not approved any requests to list the shares of digital asset funds like the Trust to date. The requests to list the shares of digital asset funds submitted by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (&#8220;CBOE&#8221;) and the NYSE Arca in 2019 were withdrawn or received disapprovals. Subsequently, NYSE Arca and CBOE filed several new requests to list shares of various digital asset funds in 2021. Several of those requests were recently denied by the SEC in 2021 and to date in 2022. On October&#160;19, 2021, NYSE Arca filed an application with the SEC pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act to list the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca. On June&#160;29, 2022, the SEC denied NYSE Arca&#8217;s 19b-4 application and the Sponsor subsequently petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the SEC&#8217;s June&#160;29, 2022 final order denying approval to list shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of the date of this Annual Report, the Sponsor&#8217;s petition remains pending and as a result the Trust has not sought relief from the SEC under Regulation M to operate an ongoing redemption program, and neither the Sponsor nor the Trust makes any representation as to if or when such approval and relief will be obtained. The exchange listing of shares of digital asset funds would create more opportunities for institutional and retail investors to invest in the digital asset market. If exchange-listing requests are not approved by the SEC and further requests are ultimately denied by the SEC, increased investment interest by institutional or retail investors could fail to materialize, which could reduce the demand for digital assets generally and therefore adversely affect the value of the Shares. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Risk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Trust relies on third party service providers to perform certain functions essential to the affairs of the Trust and the replacement of such service providers could pose a challenge to the safekeeping of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin and to the operations of the Trust. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust relies on the Custodian, the Authorized Participant and other third party service providers to perform certain functions essential to managing the affairs of the Trust. In addition, the Authorized Participant relies on the Liquidity Provider to source Bitcoin in connection with the creation of Shares. Any disruptions to such service providers&#8217; business operations, resulting from business failures, financial instability, security failures, government mandated regulation or operational problems, could have an adverse impact on the Trust&#8217;s ability to access critical services and be disruptive to the operations of the Trust and require the Sponsor to replace such service provider. Moreover, the Sponsor could decide to replace a service provider to the Trust, or the Authorized Participant may decide to replace the Liquidity Provider for other reasons. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Sponsor decides, or is required, to replace Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC as the custodian of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins, transferring maintenance responsibilities of the Digital Asset Account to another party will likely be complex and could subject the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins to the risk of loss during the transfer, which could have a negative impact on the performance of the Shares or result in loss of the Trust&#8217;s assets. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, the legal rights of customers with respect to digital assets held on their behalf by a third-party custodian, such as the Custodian, in insolvency proceedings are currently uncertain. The Custody Agreement contains an agreement by the parties to treat the digital assets credited to the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Account as financial assets under Article 8 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code (&#8220;Article 8&#8221;), in addition to stating that the Custodian will serve as fiduciary and custodian on the Trust&#8217;s behalf. The Custodian&#8217;s parent, Coinbase Global Inc., has stated in its most recent public securities filings that in light of the inclusion in its custody agreements of provisions relating to Article 8 it believes that a court would not treat custodied digital assets as part of its general estate in the event the Custodian were to experience insolvency. However, due to the novelty of digital asset custodial arrangements courts have not yet considered this type of treatment for custodied digital assets and it is not possible to predict with certainty how they would rule in such a scenario. If the Custodian became subject to insolvency proceedings and a court were to rule that the custodied digital assets were part of the Custodian&#8217;s general estate and not the property of the Trust, then the Trust would be treated as a general unsecured creditor in the Custodian&#8217;s insolvency proceedings and the Trust would be subject to the loss of all or a significant portion of its assets. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent that Sponsor is not able to find a suitable party willing to serve as the custodian, the Sponsor may be required to terminate the Trust and liquidate the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin. In addition, to the extent that the Sponsor finds a suitable party and must enter into a modified Custodian Agreement that is less favorable for the Trust or Sponsor and/or transfer the Trust&#8217;s assets in a relatively short time period, the safekeeping of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin may be adversely affected, which may in turn adversely affect value of the Shares. Likewise, if the Sponsor and/or the Authorized Participant is required to replace any other service provider, they may not be able to find a party willing to serve in such capacity in a timely manner or at all. If the Sponsor decides, or is required, to replace the Authorized Participant and/or if the Authorized Participant decides, or is required, to replace the Liquidity Provider, this could negatively impact the Trust&#8217;s ability to create new Shares, which would impact the Shares&#8217; liquidity and could have a negative impact on the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Because of the holding period under Rule 144, the lack of an ongoing redemption program and the Trust&#8217;s ability to halt creations from time to time, there is no arbitrage mechanism to keep the value of the Shares closely linked to the Index Price and the Shares have historically traded at a substantial premium over, or substantial discount to, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shares purchased in the private placement are subject to a holding period under Rule 144. Pursuant to Rule 144, the minimum holding period for Shares purchased in the private placement is six months. In addition, the Trust does not currently operate an ongoing redemption program and may halt creations from time to time. As a result, the Trust cannot rely on arbitrage opportunities resulting from differences between the value of the Shares and the price of Bitcoin to keep the value of the Shares closely linked to the Index Price. As a result, the value of the Shares of the Trust may not approximate the value of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share or meet the Trust&#8217;s investment objective, and may trade at a substantial premium over, or substantial discount to, the value of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share. For example, in the past, the price of the Shares as quoted on OTCQX varied significantly from the Digital Asset Holdings per Share due to these factors, among others, and has historically traded at a substantial premium over, and a substantial discount to, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Shares may trade at a price that is at, above or below the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share as a result of the non- current trading hours between OTCQX and the Digital Asset Exchange Market. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of Bitcoin, and the Sponsor expects the trading price of the Shares to fluctuate in accordance with changes in the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share, as well as market supply and demand. However, the Shares may trade on OTCQX at, above or below the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share for a variety of reasons. For example, OTCQX is open for trading in the Shares for a limited period each day, but the Digital Asset Exchange </p>

Market is a 24-hour marketplace. During periods when OTCQX is closed but Digital Asset Exchanges are open, significant changes in the price of Bitcoin on the Digital Asset Exchange Market could result in a difference in performance between the value of Bitcoin as measured by the Index and the most recent Digital Asset Holdings per Share or closing trading price. For example, if the price of Bitcoin on the Digital Asset Exchange Market, and the value of Bitcoin as measured by the Index, moves significantly in a negative direction after the close of OTCQX, the trading price of the Shares may &#8220;gap&#8221; down to the full extent of such negative price shift when OTCQX reopens. If the price of Bitcoin on the Digital Asset Exchange Market drops significantly during hours OTCQX is closed, shareholders may not be able to sell their Shares until after the &#8220;gap&#8221; down has been fully realized, resulting in an inability to mitigate losses in a rapidly negative market. Even during periods when OTCQX is open, large Digital Asset Exchanges (or a substantial number of smaller Digital Asset Exchanges) may be lightly traded or closed for any number of reasons, which could increase trading spreads and widen any premium or discount on the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Shareholders may suffer a loss on their investment if the Shares trade above or below the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, the Shares have traded at both premiums and discounts to the Digital Asset Holdings per Share, which at times have been substantial. If the Shares trade at a premium, investors who purchase Shares on OTCQX will pay more for their Shares than investors who purchase Shares directly from Authorized Participants. In contrast, if the Shares trade on OTCQX at a discount, investors who purchase Shares directly from Authorized Participants will pay more for their Shares than investors who purchase Shares on OTCQX. The premium or discount at which the Shares have traded has fluctuated over time. From May&#160;5, 2015 to December&#160;31, 2022, the maximum premium of the closing price of the Shares quoted on OTCQX over the value of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share was 142% and the average premium was 37%. Moreover, the closing price of the Shares as quoted on OTCQX at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each business day between May 5, 2015 to December 31, 2022, has been quoted at a discount on 468 days. From May&#160;5, 2015 to December&#160;31, 2022, the maximum discount of the closing price of the Shares quoted on OTCQX below the value of the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share was 49% and the average discount was 23%. As of December&#160;30, 2022, the last business day of the period, the Trust&#8217;s Shares were quoted on OTCQX at a discount of 45% to the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings per Share. As a result, shareholders who purchase Shares on OTCQX may suffer a loss on their investment if they sell their Shares at a time when the premium has decreased from the premium at which they purchased the Shares even if the Digital Asset Holdings per Share remains the same. Likewise, shareholders that purchase Shares directly from the Trust may suffer a loss on their investment if they sell their Shares at a time when the Shares are trading at a discount on OTCQX. Furthermore, shareholders may suffer a loss on their investment even if the Digital Asset Holdings per Share increases because the decrease in any premium or increase in any discount may offset any increase in the Digital Asset Holdings per Share. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The amount of the Trust&#8217;s assets represented by each Share will decline over time as the Trust pays the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee and Additional Trust Expenses, and as a result, the value of the Shares may decrease over time. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee accrues daily in U.S. dollars at an annual rate based on the Digital Asset Holdings Fee Basis Amount, which is based on the Digital Asset Holdings of the Trust, and is paid to the Sponsor in Bitcoin. See &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Valuation of Bitcoin and Determination of Digital Asset Holdings&#8212;Disposition of Bitcoins, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Activities of the Trust&#8212;Hypothetical Expense Example.&#8221; As a result, the amount of Trust&#8217;s assets represented by each Share declines as the Trust pays the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee (or sells Bitcoin in order to raise cash to pay any Additional Trust Expenses), which may cause the Shares to decrease in value over time or dampen any increase in value. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The value of the Shares may be influenced by a variety of factors unrelated to the value of Bitcoin. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The value of the Shares may be influenced by a variety of factors unrelated to the price of Bitcoin and the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Index that may have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares.

To accomplish these ends, the Investment Company Act requires the safekeeping and proper valuation of fund assets, restricts greatly transactions with affiliates, limits leveraging, and imposes governance requirements as a check on fund management. </p> <p style="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act, and the Sponsor believes that the Trust is not required to register under such act. Consequently, shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies. </p> <p style="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity interests regulated by the CEA, as administered by the CFTC. Furthermore, the Sponsor believes that the Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA, and that neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is subject to regulation by the CFTC as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with the operation of the Trust. Consequently, shareholders will not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in CEA-regulated instruments or commodity pools. </p> <p style="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The restrictions on transfer and redemption may result in losses on the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shares purchased in the private placement may not be resold except in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act and state securities laws, and any such transaction must be approved in advance by the Sponsor.

Therefore, unless the Trust is permitted to, and does, establish a Share redemption program, shareholders will be unable to (or could be significantly impeded in attempting to) sell or otherwise liquidate investments in the Shares, which could have a material adverse impact on demand for the Shares and their value. </p> <p style="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Trust and an affiliate of the Trust previously entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC concerning the operation of the Trust&#8217;s former redemption program. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&#160;1, 2014, a program was launched pursuant to which shareholders could request redemptions from Genesis, an affiliate of the Trust and the sole Authorized Participant at that time. On September&#160;23, 2014, Genesis received a letter from the staff of the SEC&#8217;s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations summarizing the staff&#8217;s findings from an onsite review of Genesis&#8217;s broker-dealer activities conducted in June 2014. In its exit report, the staff stated that it had concluded that the Trust&#8217;s redemption program, in which shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their Shares through Genesis, appeared to violate Regulation M under the Exchange Act because such redemptions of Shares took place at the same time the Trust was in the process of creating Shares. On July&#160;11, 2016, Genesis and the Trust entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC whereby they agreed to a cease-and-desist order against future violations of Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Genesis also agreed to pay disgorgement of $51,650.11 in redemption fees it collected, plus prejudgment interest of $2,105.68, for a total of $53,755.79. The Trust currently has no intention of seeking an exemption from the SEC under Regulation M in order to reinstate its redemption program. </p> <p style="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">There is no guarantee that an active trading market for the Shares will continue to develop. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Shares are qualified for public trading on OTCQX and an active trading market for the Shares has developed. However, there can be no assurance that such trading market will be maintained or continue to develop. In addition, OTCQX can halt the trading of the Shares for a variety of reasons. To the extent that OTCQX halts trading in the Shares, whether on a temporary or permanent basis, investors may not be able to buy or sell Shares, which could adversely affect the value of the Shares. If an active trading market for the Shares does not continue to exist, the market prices and liquidity of the Shares may be adversely affected. </p> <p style="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&#160;19, 2021, NYSE Arca filed an application with the SEC pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act to list the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca. NYSE Arca must receive approval from the SEC in order to list the Shares. During 2016 and 2017, NYSE Arca and other exchanges filed several requests with the SEC to list the shares of digital asset funds, including the Shares. After the SEC issued disapprovals for a number of these requests, NYSE Arca withdrew its request relating to the Shares. Although the SEC approved several futures-based Bitcoin ETFs in October 2021, it has not approved any requests to list the shares of digital asset funds like the Trust to date. The requests to list the shares of digital asset funds submitted by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (&#8220;CBOE&#8221;) and the NYSE Arca in 2019 were withdrawn or received disapprovals. Subsequently, NYSE Arca and CBOE filed several new requests to list shares of various digital asset funds in 2021. Several of those requests were recently denied by the SEC in 2021 and 2022, including the second request by NYSE Arca to list the Shares of the Trust, which was denied in June 2022. The Sponsor subsequently petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the SEC&#8217;s June&#160;29, 2022 final order denying approval to list shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Sponsor&#8217;s petition remains pending and the Trust has not sought relief from the SEC under Regulation M to operate an ongoing redemption program, and neither the Sponsor nor the Trust makes any representation as to if or when such approval and relief will be obtained. As such, there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will be successful in listing the Shares on NYSE Arca even once the Sponsor decides to do so. </p>

The Sponsor believes that the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins held in the Digital Asset Account will be an appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy, damage or steal the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins and will only become more appealing as the Trust&#8217;s assets grow. To the extent that the Trust, the Sponsor or the Custodian is unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats or otherwise adapt to technological changes in the digital asset industry, the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor believes that the security procedures in place for the Trust, including, but not limited to, offline storage, or cold storage, multiple encrypted private key &#8220;shards&#8221;, usernames, passwords and 2-step verification, are reasonably designed to safeguard the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins. Nevertheless, the security procedures cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God that may be borne by the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The security procedures and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee of the Sponsor, the Custodian, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to a Digital Asset Account, the relevant private keys (and therefore Bitcoin) or other data of the Trust. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of the Sponsor or the Custodian to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Trust&#8217;s infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Sponsor and the Custodian may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An actual or perceived breach of a Digital Asset Account could harm the Trust&#8217;s operations, result in loss of the Trust&#8217;s assets, damage the Trust&#8217;s reputation and negatively affect the market perception of the effectiveness of the Trust, all of which could in turn reduce demand for the Shares, resulting in a reduction in the value of the Shares. The Trust may also cease operations, the occurrence of which could similarly result in a reduction in the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Bitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred Bitcoins may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed Bitcoin transactions could adversely affect the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bitcoin transactions are typically not reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the Blockchain, an incorrect transfer or theft of Bitcoin generally will not be reversible and the Trust may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. Although the Trust&#8217;s transfers of Bitcoin will regularly be made to or from the Digital Asset Account, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin could be transferred from the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Account in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Such events have occurred in connection with digital assets in the past. For example, in September 2014, the Chinese Digital Asset Exchange Huobi announced that it had sent approximately 900 Bitcoins and 8,000 Litecoins (worth approximately $400,000 at the prevailing market prices at the time) to the wrong customers. To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party which has received the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins through error or theft, the Trust will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred Bitcoins. The Trust will also be unable to convert or recover its Bitcoins transferred to uncontrolled accounts. To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss could adversely affect the value of the Shares. </p>

In addition, neither the Trust nor the Sponsor insure the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins. While the Custodian has advised the Sponsor that it has insurance coverage of up to $320 million that covers losses of the digital assets it custodies on behalf of its clients, including the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin, resulting from theft, shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian will maintain adequate insurance or that such coverage will cover losses with respect to the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins. While the Custodian maintains certain capital reserve requirements depending on the assets under custody, and such capital reserves may provide additional means to cover client asset losses, the Sponsor does not know the amount of such capital reserves, and neither the Trust nor the Sponsor have access to such information. The Trust cannot be assured that the Custodian will maintain capital reserves sufficient to cover losses with respect to the Trust&#8217;s digital assets. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, under the Custodian Agreement, the Custodian&#8217;s liability with respect to the Trust will never exceed the value of the Bitcoins on deposit in the Digital Asset Account at the time of, and directly relating to, the events giving rise to the liability occurred, as determined in accordance with the Custodian Agreement. In addition, for as long as a cold storage address holds Bitcoin with a value in excess of the Cold Storage Threshold for a period of five consecutive business days or more without being reduced to the Cold Storage Threshold or lower, the Custodian&#8217;s maximum liability for such cold storage address shall be limited to the Cold Storage Threshold. The Sponsor monitors the value of Bitcoins deposited in cold storage addresses for whether the Cold Storage Threshold has been met by determining the U.S. dollar value of Bitcoins deposited in each cold storage address on business days. The Custodian is not liable for any lost profits or any special, incidental, indirect, intangible, or consequential damages, whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not the Custodian has been advised of such losses or the Custodian knew or should have known of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Custodian is liable to the Sponsor and the Trust for the loss of any Bitcoins to the extent that the Custodian directly caused such loss through a breach of the Custodian Agreement, even if the Custodian meets its duty of exercising best efforts, and the Custodian is required to return to the Trust a quantity equal to the quantity of any such lost Bitcoin. Although the Cold Storage Threshold has never been met for a given cold storage address, to the extent it is met and not reduced within five business days, the Trust would not have a claim against the Custodian with respect to the digital assets held in such address to the extent the value exceeds the Cold Storage Threshold. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The shareholders&#8217; recourse against the Sponsor and the Trust&#8217;s other service providers for the services they provide to the Trust, including those relating to the provision of instructions relating to the movement of Bitcoin, is limited. Consequently, a loss may be suffered with respect to the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin that is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages. As a result, the recourse of the Trust or the shareholders, under New York law, is limited. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Trust may be required, or the Sponsor may deem it appropriate, to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust is required to dissolve under certain circumstances. In addition, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, dissolve the Trust for a number of reasons, including if the Sponsor determines, in its sole discretion, that it is desirable or advisable for any reason to discontinue the affairs of the Trust. For example, the Sponsor expects that it may be advisable to discontinue the affairs of the Trust if the SEC or a federal court were to determine that Bitcoin is a security under the federal securities laws, among other reasons. See &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Description of the Trust Agreement&#8212;The Trustee&#8212;Termination of the Trust.&#8221; </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Trust is required to terminate and liquidate, or the Sponsor determines in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement that it is appropriate to terminate and liquidate the Trust, such termination and liquidation could occur at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when the Actual Exchange Rate of Bitcoin is lower than the Index Price was at the time when shareholders purchased their Shares. In such a case, when the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoins are sold as part of its liquidation, the resulting proceeds distributed to shareholders will be less than if the Actual Exchange Rate were higher at the time of sale. See &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Description of the Trust Agreement&#8212;The Trustee&#8212;Termination of the Trust&#8221; for more information about the termination of the Trust, including when the termination of the Trust may be triggered by events outside the direct control of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the shareholders. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Trust Agreement includes provisions that limit shareholders&#8217; voting rights and restrict shareholders&#8217; right to bring a derivative action. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Trust Agreement, shareholders have limited voting rights and the Trust will not have regular shareholder meetings. Shareholders take no part in the management or control of the Trust. Accordingly, shareholders do not have the right to authorize actions, appoint service providers or take other actions as may be taken by shareholders of other trusts or companies where shares carry such rights. The shareholders&#8217; limited voting rights give almost all control under the Trust Agreement to the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Sponsor may take actions in the operation of the Trust that may be adverse to the interests of shareholders and may adversely affect the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, shareholders&#8217; statutory right under Delaware law to bring a derivative action (i.e., to initiate a lawsuit in the name of the Trust in order to assert a claim belonging to the Trust against a fiduciary of the Trust or against a third-party when the Trust&#8217;s management has refused to do so) is restricted.

Additionally, Section&#160;3816(e) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act specifically provides that a &#8220;beneficial owner&#8217;s right to bring a derivative action may be subject to such additional standards and restrictions, if any, as are set forth in the governing instrument of the statutory trust, including, without limitation, the requirement that beneficial owners owning a specified beneficial interest in the statutory trust join in the bringing of the derivative action.&#8221; In addition to the requirements of applicable law and in accordance with Section&#160;3816(e), the Trust Agreement provides that no shareholder will have the right, power or authority to bring or maintain a derivative action, suit or other proceeding on behalf of the Trust unless two or more shareholders who (i)&#160;are not &#8220;Affiliates&#8221; (as defined in the Trust Agreement and below) of one another and (ii)&#160;collectively hold at least 10.0% of the outstanding Shares join in the bringing or maintaining of such action, suit or other proceeding. This provision applies to any derivative actions brought in the name of the Trust other than claims under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to this additional requirement, a shareholder attempting to bring or maintain a derivative action in the name of the Trust will be required to locate other shareholders with which it is not affiliated and that have sufficient Shares to meet the 10.0% threshold based on the number of Shares outstanding on the date the claim is brought and thereafter throughout the duration of the action, suit or proceeding. This may be difficult and may result in increased costs to a shareholder attempting to seek redress in the name of the Trust in court. Moreover, if shareholders bringing a derivative action, suit or proceeding pursuant to this provision of the Trust Agreement do not hold 10.0% of the outstanding Shares on the date such an action, suit or proceeding is brought, or such shareholders are unable to maintain Share ownership meeting the 10.0% threshold throughout the duration of the action, suit or proceeding, such shareholders&#8217; derivative action may be subject to dismissal. As a result, the Trust Agreement limits the likelihood that a shareholder will be able to successfully assert a derivative action in the name of the Trust, even if such shareholder believes that he or she has a valid derivative action, suit or other proceeding to bring on behalf of the Trust. See &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Description of the Trust Agreement&#8212;The Sponsor&#8212;Fiduciary and Regulatory Duties of the Sponsor&#8221; for more detail. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Sponsor is solely responsible for determining the value of the Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share and any errors, discontinuance or changes in such valuation calculations may have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor will determine the Trust&#8217;s Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share on a daily basis as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each business day. The Sponsor&#8217;s determination is made utilizing data from the operations of the Trust and the Index Price, calculated at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such day. If the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Index does not reflect an accurate Bitcoin price, then the Sponsor will employ an alternative method to determine the Index Price under the cascading set of rules set forth in &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market&#8212;Bitcoin Value&#8212;The Index and the Index Price&#8212; Determination of the Index Price When Index Price is Unavailable.&#8221; There are no predefined criteria to make a good faith assessment as to which of the rules the Sponsor will apply and the Sponsor may make this determination in its sole discretion. The Sponsor may calculate the Index Price in a manner that ultimately inaccurately reflects the price of Bitcoin. To the extent that the Digital Asset Holdings, Digital Asset Holdings per Share or the Index Price are incorrectly calculated, the Sponsor may not be liable for any error and such misreporting of valuation data could adversely affect the value of the Shares and investors could suffer a substantial loss on their investment in the Trust. Moreover, the terms of the Trust Agreement do not prohibit the Sponsor from changing the Index Price used to calculate the Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share of the Trust. Any such change in the Index Price could affect the value of the Shares and investors could suffer a substantial loss on their investment in the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Extraordinary expenses resulting from unanticipated events may become payable by the Trust, adversely affecting the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In consideration for the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee, the Sponsor has contractually assumed all ordinary-course operational and periodic expenses of the Trust.

An unexpected or quick reversal of any such policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, could increase volatility in economies and financial market generally, and could specifically increase volatility in the Digital Asset Markets, which could adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, pandemics, epidemics and other natural and man-made disasters could disrupt the operations of many businesses. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments imposed in travel restrictions and prolonged, closed international borders and enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, which disrupted businesses around the world. While the Sponsor and the Trust were not materially impacted by these events, any disruptions to the Sponsor&#8217;s, the Trust&#8217;s or the Trust&#8217;s service providers&#8217; business operations resulting from business restrictions, quarantines or restrictions on the ability of personnel to perform their jobs as a result of any future pandemic, epidemic or other disaster could have an adverse impact on the Trust&#8217;s ability to access critical services and could be disruptive to the affairs of the Trust. </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Risk Factors Related to the Regulation of the Trust and the Shares </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Regulatory changes or actions by the U.S. Congress or any U.S. federal or state agencies may affect the value of the Shares or restrict the use of Bitcoins, mining activity or the operation of the Bitcoin Network or the Digital Asset Markets in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As digital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS and state financial institution and securities regulators) have been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital asset users and the Digital Asset Markets, with particular focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges and other service providers that hold or custody digital assets for users. Many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. Ongoing and future regulatory actions with respect to digital assets generally or Bitcoin in particular may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of an investment in the Shares or the ability of the Trust to continue to operate. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2021, the chair of the SEC stated that he believed investors using digital asset trading platforms are not adequately protected, and that activities on the platforms can implicate the securities laws, commodities laws and banking laws, raising a number of issues related to protecting investors and consumers, guarding against illicit activity, and ensuring financial stability. The chair expressed a need for the SEC to have additional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from &#8220;falling between regulatory cracks,&#8221; as well as for more resources to protect investors in &#8220;this growing and volatile sector.&#8221; The chair called for federal legislation centering on digital asset trading, lending, and decentralized finance platforms, seeking &#8220;additional plenary authority&#8221; to write rules for digital asset trading and lending. Moreover, President Biden&#8217;s March&#160;9, 2022 Executive Order, asserting that technological advances and the rapid growth of the digital asset markets &#8220;necessitate an evaluation and alignment of the United States Government approach to digital assets,&#8221; signals an ongoing focus on digital asset policy and regulation in the United States. A number of reports issued pursuant to the Executive Order have focused on various risks related to the digital asset ecosystem, and have recommended additional legislation and regulatory oversight. There have also been several bills introduced in Congress that propose to establish additional regulation and oversight of the digital asset markets. Furthermore, the SEC has recently proposed amendments to the custody rules under Rule 406(4)-2 of the Investment Advisers Act. The proposed rule changes would amend the definition of a &#8220;qualified custodian&#8221; under Rule 206(4)-2(d)(6) and expand the current custody rule in 406(4)-2 to cover digital assets and related advisory activities. If enacted as proposed, these rules would likely impose additional regulatory requirements with respect to the custody and storage of digital assets and could lead to additional regulatory oversight of the digital asset ecosystem more broadly. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is difficult to predict whether, or when, any of these developments will lead to Congress granting additional authorities to the SEC or other regulators, what the nature of such additional authorities might be, how additional legislation and/or regulatory oversight might impact the ability of Digital Asset Markets to function or how any new regulations or changes to existing regulations might impact the value of digital assets generally and Bitcoin held by the Trust specifically. The consequences of increased federal regulation of digital assets and digital asset activities could have a material adverse effect on the Trust and the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Law enforcement agencies have often relied on the transparency of blockchains to facilitate investigations. However, certain privacy-enhancing features have been, or are expected to be, introduced to a number of digital asset networks. If the Bitcoin Network were to adopt any of these features, these features may provide law enforcement agencies with less visibility into transaction-level data. Europol, the European Union&#8217;s law enforcement agency, released a report in October 2017 noting the increased use of privacy- enhancing digital assets like Zcash and Monero in criminal activity on the internet. In August 2022, OFAC banned all U.S. citizens from using Tornado Cash, a digital asset protocol designed to obfuscate blockchain transactions, by adding certain Ethereum wallet addresses associated with the protocol to its Specially Designated Nationals list. Approximately 60% of Ethereum validators, as well as notable industry participants such as Centre, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, have reportedly complied with the sanctions and blacklisted the sanctioned addresses from interacting with their networks. Although no regulatory action has been taken to treat privacy-enhancing digital assets differently, this may change in the future. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">A determination that Bitcoin or any other digital asset is a &#8220;security&#8221; may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and the value of the Shares, and result in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to, or termination of, the Trust. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Depending on its characteristics, a digital asset may be considered a &#8220;security&#8221; under the federal securities laws. The test for determining whether a particular digital asset is a &#8220;security&#8221; is complex and difficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Public, though non-binding, statements by senior officials at the SEC have indicated that the SEC did not consider Bitcoin or Ethereum to be securities, and does not currently consider Bitcoin to be a security. The SEC staff has also provided informal assurances to a handful of promoters that their digital assets are not securities. On the other hand, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against the issuers and promoters of several other digital assets on the basis that the digital assets in question are securities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Whether a digital asset is a security under the federal securities laws depends on whether it is included in the lists of instruments making up the definition of &#8220;security&#8221; in the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. Digital assets as such do not appear in any of these lists, although each list includes the terms &#8220;investment contract&#8221; and &#8220;note,&#8221; and the SEC has typically analyzed whether a particular digital asset is a security by reference to whether it meets the tests developed by the federal courts </p>

interpreting these terms, known as the <span style="font-style:italic">Howey</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Reves</span> tests, respectively. For many digital assets, whether or not the <span style="font-style:italic">Howey</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Reves</span> tests are met is difficult to resolve definitively, and substantial legal arguments can often be made both in favor of and against a particular digital asset qualifying as a security under one or both of the <span style="font-style:italic">Howey</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Reves</span> tests. Adding to the complexity, the SEC staff has indicated that the security status of a particular digital asset can change over time as the relevant facts evolve. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of determining whether Bitcoin is a security for purposes of the federal securities laws, the Sponsor takes into account a number of factors, including the various definitions of &#8220;security&#8221; under the federal securities laws and federal court decisions interpreting elements of these definitions, such as the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s decisions in the <span style="font-style:italic">Howey</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Reves</span> cases, as well as reports, orders, press releases, public statements and speeches by the SEC and its staff providing guidance on when a digital asset may be a security for purposes of the federal securities laws. Finally, the Sponsor discusses the security status of Bitcoin with its external securities lawyers. Through this process the Sponsor believes that it is applying the proper legal standards in determining that Bitcoin is not a security in light of the uncertainties inherent in the <span style="font-style:italic">Howey</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Reves</span> tests. In light of these uncertainties and the fact-based nature of the analysis, the Sponsor acknowledges that Bitcoin may currently be a security, based on the facts as they exist today, or may in the future be found by the SEC or a federal court to be a security under the federal securities laws notwithstanding the Sponsor&#8217;s prior conclusion; and the Sponsor&#8217;s prior conclusion, even if reasonable under the circumstances, would not preclude legal or regulatory action based on the presence of a security. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As is the case with Bitcoin, analyses from counsel typically review the often-complex facts surrounding a particular digital asset&#8217;s underlying technology, creation, use case and usage, distribution and secondary-market trading characteristics as well as contributions of the individuals or organizations who appear to be involved in these activities, among other relevant facts, usually drawing on publicly available information. This information, usually found on the Internet, often includes both information that originated with or is attributed to such individuals or organizations, as well as information from third party sources and databases that may or may not have a connection to such individuals or organizations, and the availability and nature of such information can change over time. The Sponsor and counsel often have no independent means of verifying the accuracy or completeness of such information, and therefore of necessity usually must assume that such information is materially accurate and complete for purposes of the <span style="font-style:italic">Howey</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Reves</span> analyses. After having gathered this information, counsel typically analyzes it in light of the <span style="font-style:italic">Howey</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Reves</span> tests, in order to inform a judgment as to whether or not a federal court would conclude that the digital asset in question is or is not a security for purposes of the federal securities laws. Often, certain factors appear to support a conclusion that the digital asset in question is a security, while other factors appear to support the opposite conclusion, and in such a case counsel endeavors to weigh the importance and relevance of the competing factors. This analytical process is further complicated by the fact that, at present, federal judicial case law applying the relevant tests to digital assets is scant, with no federal appellate court having considered the question on the merits, as well as the fact that because each digital asset presents its own unique set of relevant facts, it is not always possible to directly analogize the analysis of one digital asset to another. Because of this factual complexity and the current lack of a well-developed body of federal case law applying the relevant tests to a variety of different fact patterns, the Sponsor has not in the past received, and currently does not expect that it would be able to receive, &#8220;opinions&#8221; of counsel stating that a particular digital asset is or is not a security for federal securities law purposes. The Sponsor understands that as a matter of practice, counsel is generally able to render a legal &#8220;opinion&#8221; only when the relevant facts are substantially ascertainable and the applicable law is both well-developed and settled. As a result, given the relative novelty of digital assets, the challenges inherent in fact-gathering for particular digital assets, and the fact that federal courts have only recently been tasked with adjudicating the applicability of federal securities law to digital assets, the Sponsor understands that at present counsel is generally not in a position to render a legal &#8220;opinion&#8221; on the securities-law status of Bitcoin or any other particular digital asset. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Sponsor determines that Bitcoin is a security under the federal securities laws, whether that determination is initially made by the Sponsor itself, or because the SEC or a federal court subsequently makes that determination, the Sponsor does not intend to permit the Trust to continue holding Bitcoin in violation of the federal securities laws (and therefore would either dissolve the Trust or potentially seek to operate the Trust in a manner that complies with the federal securities laws, including the Investment Company Act). Because the legal tests for determining whether a digital asset is or is not a security often leave room for interpretation, for so long as the Sponsor believes there to be good faith grounds to conclude that the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin is not a security, the Sponsor does not intend to dissolve the Trust on the basis that Bitcoin could at some future point be determined to be a security. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any enforcement action by the SEC or a state securities regulator asserting that Bitcoin is a security, or a court decision, to that effect would be expected to have an immediate material adverse impact on the trading value of Bitcoin, as well as the Shares. This is because the business models behind most digital assets are incompatible with regulations applying to transactions in securities. If a digital asset is determined or asserted to be a security, it is likely to become difficult or impossible for the digital asset to be traded, cleared or custodied in the United States through the same channels used by non-security digital assets, which in addition to materially and adversely affecting the trading value of the digital asset is likely to significantly impact its liquidity and market participants&#8217; ability to convert the digital asset into U.S. dollars. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, in 2020 the SEC filed a complaint against the issuer of XRP, Ripple Labs, Inc., and two of its executives, alleging that they raised more than $1.3 billion through XRP sales that should have been registered under the federal securities laws, but were not. In the years prior to the SEC&#8217;s action, XRP&#8217;s market capitalization at times reached over $140 billion. However, in the weeks following the SEC&#8217;s complaint, XRP&#8217;s market capitalization fell to less than $10 billion, which was less than half of its market </p>

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
capitalization in the days prior to the complaint. The SEC&#8217;s action against XRP&#8217;s issuer underscores the continuing uncertainty around which digital assets are securities, and demonstrates that such factors as how long a digital asset has been in existence, how widely held it is, how large its market capitalization is and that it has actual usefulness in commercial transactions, ultimately may have no bearing on whether the SEC or a court will find it to be a security. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, if Bitcoin is determined to be a security, the Trust could be considered an unregistered &#8220;investment company&#8221; under SEC rules, which could necessitate the Trust&#8217;s liquidation. In this case, the Trust and the Sponsor may be deemed to have participated in an illegal offering of securities and there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will be able to register the Trust under the Investment Company Act at such time or take such other actions as may be necessary to ensure the Trust&#8217;s activities comply with applicable law, which could force the Sponsor to liquidate the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, whether or not the Sponsor or the Trust were subject to additional regulatory requirements as a result of any SEC or federal court determination that its assets include securities, the Sponsor may nevertheless decide to terminate the Trust, in order, if possible, to liquidate the Trust&#8217;s assets while a liquid market still exists. For example, in response to the SEC&#8217;s action against the issuer of XRP, certain significant market participants announced they would no longer support XRP and announced measures, including the delisting of XRP from major digital asset trading platforms, resulting in the Sponsor&#8217;s conclusion that it was likely to be increasingly difficult for U.S. investors, including Grayscale XRP Trust (XRP), an affiliate of the Trust, to convert XRP into U.S. dollars. The Sponsor subsequently dissolved Grayscale XRP Trust (XRP) and liquidated its assets. If the SEC or a federal court were to determine that Bitcoin is a security, it is likely that the value of the Shares of the Trust would decline significantly, and that the Trust itself may be terminated and, if practical, its assets liquidated. </p> <p style="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Changes in SEC policy could adversely impact the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The effect of any future regulatory change on the Trust or the digital assets held by the Trust is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to the Trust and the value of the Shares. In particular, the SEC has not yet approved the listing on a national securities exchange of any non-futures based digital-asset focused exchange- traded fund (&#8220;ETF&#8221;). If the SEC were to approve any such ETF in the future, such an ETF may be perceived to be a superior investment product offering exposure to digital assets compared to the Trust because the value of the shares issued by such an ETF would be expected to more closely track the ETF&#8217;s net asset value than do Shares of the Trust, and investors may therefore favor investments in such ETFs over investments in the Trust. Any weakening in demand for the Shares compared to digital asset ETF shares could cause the value of the Shares to decline. </p> <p style="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Competing industries may have more influence with policymakers than the digital asset industry, which could lead to the adoption of laws and regulations that are harmful to the digital asset industry. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The digital asset industry is relatively new, although its influence over public policy is increasing, and it does not have the same access to policymakers and lobbying organizations in many jurisdictions compared to industries with which digital assets may be seen to compete, such as banking, payments and consumer finance. Competitors from other, more established industries may have greater access to and influence with governmental officials and regulators and may be successful in persuading these policymakers that digital assets require heightened levels of regulation compared to the regulation of traditional financial services. As a result, new laws and regulations may be proposed and adopted in the United States and elsewhere, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that disfavor or impose compliance burdens on the digital asset industry or digital asset platforms, which could adversely impact the value of Bitcoin and therefore the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Regulatory changes or other events in foreign jurisdictions may affect the value of the Shares or restrict the use of one or more digital assets, mining activity or the operation of their networks or the Digital Asset Exchange Market in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Various foreign jurisdictions have, and may continue to adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the digital asset network, the Digital Asset Markets, and their users, particularly Digital Asset Exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions&#8217; regulatory scope. For example, if China or other foreign jurisdictions were to ban or otherwise restrict mining activity, including by regulating or limiting manufacturers&#8217; ability to produce or sell semiconductors or hard drives in connection with mining, it would have a material adverse effect on digital asset networks (including the Bitcoin Network), the Digital Asset Market, and as a result, impact the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A number of foreign jurisdictions have recently taken regulatory action aimed at digital asset activities. China has made transacting in cryptocurrencies illegal for Chinese citizens in mainland China, and additional restrictions may follow. Both China and South Korea have banned initial coin offerings entirely and regulators in other jurisdictions, including Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong, have opined that initial coin offerings may constitute securities offerings subject to local securities regulations. In May 2021, the Chinese government announced renewed efforts to restrict cryptocurrency trading and mining activities, citing concerns about high energy consumption and its desire to promote financial stability. Regulators in the Inner Mongolia and other regions of China have proposed regulations that would create penalties for companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining activities and introduce heightened energy saving requirements on industrial parks, data centers and power plants providing electricity to cryptocurrency miners. The United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority published final rules in October 2020 banning the sale of derivatives and exchange traded notes that reference certain types of digital assets, contending that they are &#8220;ill-suited&#8221; to retail investors citing extreme volatility, valuation challenges and association with financial crime. A new bill, the Financial Services and Markets Bill (&#8220;FSMB&#8221;), has made its way through the House of Commons and is expected to work through the House of Lords and become law in 2023. The FSMB would bring digital asset activities within the scope of existing laws governing financial institutions, markets and assets. In addition, the European Council of the European Union approved the text of MiCA in October 2022, establishing a regulatory framework for digital asset services across the European Union. MiCA is intended to serve as a comprehensive regulation of digital asset markets and imposes various obligations on digital asset issuers and service providers. The main aims of MiCA are industry regulation, consumer protection, prevention of market abuse and upholding the integrity of digital asset markets. MiCA is expected to pass the European Parliament in 2023 and come into effect in 2024. See &#8220;Item 1.

 <p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Foreign laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively impact the acceptance of one or more digital assets by users, merchants and service providers outside the United States and may therefore impede the growth or sustainability of the digital asset economy in the European Union, China, Japan, Russia and the United States and globally, or otherwise negatively affect the value of Bitcoin. Moreover, other events, such as the interruption in telecommunications or Internet services, cyber-related terrorist acts, civil disturbances, war or other catastrophes, could also negatively affect the digital asset economy in one or more jurisdictions. For example, Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine on February&#160;24, 2022 led to volatility in digital asset prices, with an initial steep decline followed by a sharp rebound in prices. The effect of any future regulatory change or other events on the Trust or Bitcoin is impossible to predict, and such change could be substantial and adverse to the Trust and the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">If regulators or public utilities take actions that restrict or otherwise impact mining activities, there may be a significant decline in such activities, which could adversely affect the Bitcoin Network and the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concerns have been raised about the electricity required to secure and maintain digital asset networks. For example, as of December&#160;31, 2022, over 274&#160;million tera hashes are performed every second in connection with mining on the Bitcoin Network. Although measuring the electricity consumed by this process is difficult because these operations are performed by various machines with varying levels of efficiency, the process consumes a significant amount of energy. The operations of the Bitcoin Network and other digital asset networks may also consume significant amounts of energy. Further, in addition to the direct energy costs of performing calculations on any given digital asset network, there are indirect costs that impact a network&#8217;s total energy consumption, including the costs of cooling the machines that perform these calculations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Driven by concerns around energy consumption and the impact on public utility companies, various states and cities have implemented, or are considering implementing, moratoriums on mining activity in their jurisdictions. For example, in November 2022, New York imposed a two-year moratorium on new proof-of-work mining permits at fossil fuel plants in the state. A significant reduction in mining activity as a result of such actions could adversely affect the security of the Bitcoin Network by making it easier for a malicious actor or botnet to manipulate the Blockchain. See &#8220;&#8212;If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on the Bitcoin Network, or otherwise obtains control over the Bitcoin Network through its influence over core developers or otherwise, such actor or botnet could manipulate the Blockchain to adversely affect the value of the Shares or the ability of the Trust to operate.&#8221; If regulators or public utilities take action that restricts or otherwise impacts mining activities, such actions could result in decreased security of a digital asset network, including the Bitcoin Network, and consequently adversely impact the value of the Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">If regulators subject an Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor to regulation as a money service business or money transmitter, this could result in extraordinary expenses to the Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor and also result in decreased liquidity for the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent that the activities of any Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor cause it to be deemed a &#8220;money services business&#8221; under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN, such Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate the Authorized Participant to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records.

An Authorized Participant may instead decide to terminate its role as Authorized Participant of the Trust, or the Sponsor may decide to discontinue and wind up the Trust.

Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Rather, if the Trust is a grantor trust, each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated as directly owning its pro rata share of the Trust&#8217;s assets and a pro rata portion of the Trust&#8217;s income, gain, losses and deductions will &#8220;flow through&#8221; to each beneficial owner of Shares. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Trust has taken certain positions with respect to the tax consequences of Incidental Rights and its receipt of IR Virtual Currency. If the IRS were to disagree with, and successfully challenge any of these positions the Trust might not qualify as a grantor trust. In addition, the Sponsor has delivered the Pre-Creation Abandonment Notices to the former custodian and the Custodian stating that the Trust is irrevocably abandoning, effective immediately prior to each Creation Time, all Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to which it would otherwise be entitled as of such time and with respect to which it has not taken any Affirmative Action at or prior to such time. The Trust has also abandoned Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency through Affirmative Actions. There can be no complete assurance that these abandonments will be treated as effective for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Trust were treated as owning any asset other than Bitcoins as of any date on which it creates Shares, it would likely cease to qualify as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the evolving nature of digital assets, it is not possible to predict potential future developments that may arise with respect to digital assets, including forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences.

However, due to the uncertain treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as discussed below in &#8220;Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences&#8212;Uncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Digital Assets&#8221;), there can be no assurance in this regard. If the Trust were classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax consequences of owning Shares generally would not be materially different from the tax consequences described herein, although there might be certain differences, including with respect to timing of the recognition of taxable income or loss. In addition, tax information reports provided to beneficial owners of Shares would be made in a different form. If the Trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be classified as a corporation for such purposes. In that event, the Trust would be subject to entity-level U.S. federal income tax (currently at the rate of 21%) on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trust&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Any such dividend distributed to a beneficial owner of Shares that is a non-U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as provided in an applicable tax treaty). </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes is uncertain. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed in the section entitled &#8220;Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences&#8212;Uncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Digital Assets&#8221; below, assuming that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of an undivided interest in the Bitcoin (and, if applicable, any Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency) held in the Trust.

In 2019, the IRS released a revenue ruling and a set of &#8220;Frequently Asked Questions&#8221; (the &#8220;Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs&#8221;) that provide some additional guidance, including guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital assets are taxable events giving rise to ordinary income and guidance with respect to the determination of the tax basis of digital assets. However, the Notice and the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs do not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets. Moreover, although the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs address the treatment of hard forks, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of the income inclusions. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There can be no assurance that the IRS will not alter its position with respect to digital assets in the future or that a court would uphold the treatment set forth in the Notice and the Ruling&#160;&amp; FAQs. It is also unclear what additional guidance on the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be issued in the future. Any such alteration of the current IRS positions or additional guidance could result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders and could have an adverse effect on the value of Bitcoin. Future developments that may arise with respect to digital assets may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, the Notice addresses only digital assets that are &#8220;convertible virtual currency,&#8221; and it is conceivable that, as a result of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence, the Trust will hold certain types of digital assets that are not within the scope of the Notice. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of owning and disposing of Shares and digital assets in general. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Future developments regarding the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes could adversely affect the value of the Shares. </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed above, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets, such as Bitcoin, are uncertain, and it is unclear what guidance on the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be issued in the future.

It is possible, for example, that a non-U.S. jurisdiction would impose sales tax or value- added tax on purchases and sales of digital assets for fiat currency. If a foreign jurisdiction with a significant share of the market of Bitcoin users imposes onerous tax burdens on digital asset users, or imposes sales or value-added tax on purchases and sales of digital assets for fiat currency, such actions could result in decreased demand for Bitcoin in such jurisdiction. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any future guidance on the treatment of digital assets for state, local or non-U.S. tax purposes could increase the expenses of the Trust and could have an adverse effect on the prices of digital assets, including on the price of Bitcoin in the Digital Asset Markets.

In the absence of guidance to the contrary, it is possible that any such income recognized by a U.S. tax-exempt shareholder would constitute &#8220;unrelated business taxable income&#8221; (&#8220;UBTI&#8221;).

On March&#160;10, 2021, the Board of the Sponsor approved the purchase by DCG, the parent company of the Sponsor, of up to $250 million worth of Shares of the Trust. Subsequently, DCG authorized such purchase. On April&#160;30, 2021, the Board approved the purchase by DCG of up to $750 million worth of Shares of the Trust. This increased DCG&#8217;s prior authorization to purchase up to $250 million worth of Shares by $500 million. On October&#160;20, 2021, the Board approved the purchase by DCG of up to $1 billion worth of Shares of the Trust. Subsequently, DCG authorized such purchase. This increased DCG&#8217;s prior authorization to purchase up to $750 million worth of Shares by $250 million. On March&#160;2, 2022, the Board of the Sponsor approved the purchase by DCG of up to an aggregate total of $200 million worth of Shares of the Trust and shares of any of the following five investment products the Sponsor also acts as the sponsor and manager of, including Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH) (OTCQX: BCHG), Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC(OTCQX: GDLC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH) (OTCQX: ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC) (OTCQX: ETCG) and Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust (XLM) (OTCQX: GXLM). This increased DCG&#8217;s prior authorization to purchase up to $1 billion worth of Shares by up to a maximum of $200 million. The Share purchase authorization does not obligate DCG to acquire any specific number of Shares in any period, and may be expanded, extended, modified, or discontinued at any time. From March&#160;10, 2021 through June&#160;30, 2022, DCG purchased a total of $771.8 million worth of Shares of the Trust under this authorization. From July&#160;1, 2022 through December&#160;31, 2022, DCG did not purchase any Shares of the Trust under this authorization; however, in the event DCG chooses to purchase additional Shares of the Trust, such purchase would further increase DCG&#8217;s ownership interest in the Trust, which, could ultimately result in DCG holding a majority of the Shares representing ownership in the Trust, and its interests as a shareholder may conflict with the interests of the Trust&#8217;s other shareholders; </p></td></tr></table> <p style="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

Because such a determination could reflect negatively upon the Index Provider, lead to a decrease in the Index Provider&#8217;s revenue or otherwise adversely affect the Index Provider, and because of their affiliation, the Index Provider may be incentivized to resolve any questions regarding, or changes to, the manner in which the Index is constructed and in which the Index Price is calculated in a way that favors the Sponsor. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, although the Index does not currently include data from over-the-counter markets or derivatives platforms, the Index Provider may decide to include pricing from such markets or platforms in the future, which could include data from Genesis.

DCG&#8217;s minority interest of less than 1.0% in the parent company of the Custodian may present risks to shareholders to the extent DCG causes the Sponsor to favor the Custodian&#8217;s interests over the interests of the Trust or its shareholders with respect to, for example, fees charged and the quality of service provided by the Custodian. Similarly, it is possible that investors could have concerns that DCG&#8217;s interest in Coinbase, Inc. could cause it to refrain from taking actions that are in the best interests of the Trust but that could harm the Custodian.

Executive officers of the Custodian&#8217;s parent company have made public statements indicating that the Custodian will remain a qualified custodian under the proposed SEC rule, if enacted as currently proposed.

Moreover, no counsel has been appointed to represent an investor in connection with the offering of the Shares.

Although CoinDesk&#8217;s policy is to shield its editorial operations from DCG&#8217;s control, it is possible that CoinDesk&#8217;s news coverage could influence trading prices and demand for digital assets, including Bitcoin, and it is also possible that consumers of CoinDesk content may not appreciate that CoinDesk&#8217;s owner has substantial financial interests in digital assets, despite information to that effect on CoinDesk&#8217;s website. As a result, some consumers of CoinDesk&#8217;s content may place greater weight on such content than they would if they were aware of DCG&#8217;s ownership stake, and this could cause the trading prices of digital assets, including Bitcoin, to be higher than they would be otherwise. </p> <p style="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

The Sponsor and the Trust disputed Fir Tree&#8217;s entitlement to the requested books and records and, therefore, declined to comply with the demand. On December 6, 2022, Fir Tree filed a suit in Delaware Chancery Court against the Sponsor and the Trust alleging that the Sponsor and the Trust violated Fir Tree&#8217;s information rights and seeking to compel access to the requested books and records. Trial has been set for May 10, 2023. The Sponsor and the Trust believe that this lawsuit is without merit and are vigorously defending against it. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January 30, 2023, Osprey Funds, LLC filed a suit in Connecticut Superior Court against the Sponsor alleging that statements the Sponsor made in its advertising and promotion of the Trust violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. The Sponsor has not yet filed its response. The Sponsor and the Trust believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against it. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2021, NYSE Arca filed a proposal with the SEC pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act for a rule change to list the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca as an exchange traded product, and on June 29, 2022, the SEC issued a final order disapproving NYSE Arca&#8217;s proposed rule change. On June 29, 2022, the Sponsor filed a petition for review of the SEC&#8217;s final order in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Sponsor&#8217;s petition remains pending in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of the date of this report, the Sponsor does not expect the foregoing proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Trust&#8217;s business, financial condition or results of operations. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor and/or the Trust may be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes in the future. </p> <p style="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

Since October&#160;3, 2022, Grayscale Securities has been the only acting Authorized Participant of the Trust and has engaged Genesis as a Liquidity Provider to source Bitcoin on its behalf in connection with the creation of Shares. The Shares are quoted on OTCQX under the ticker symbol &#8220;GBTC.&#8221; Over-the-counter market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Holders of Record </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&#160;31, 2022, there were approximately 65 holders of record. This includes Cede&#160;&amp; Co. as nominee for DTC for the Shares traded on OTCQX, but not its direct participants. Therefore, this number does not include the individual holders who have bought Shares on OTCQX or transferred their eligible Shares to their brokerage accounts. Because most of the Trust&#8217;s Shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of shareholders represented by these record holders. </p>

The Shares were sold in connection with an ongoing offering pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Genesis acted as the Authorized Participant with respect to these distributions. In exchange for these sales, the Trust received an aggregate of 694,811.86692579 Bitcoins. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2022, the Registrant did not distribute any Shares. Because Shares have been, and continue to be, created and issued on a periodic basis, a &#8220;distribution,&#8221; as such term is used in the Securities Act, may be occurring from time to time. As a result, the Authorized Participant facilitating the creation of Shares and acting as a distributor and marketer during any such period may be deemed an &#8220;underwriter&#8221; under Section&#160;2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid to the Authorized Participant with respect to such sales. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Purchases of Equity Securities </span></p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers &#8212;The table below sets forth information regarding open market purchases of Shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (OTCQX: GBTC) by Digital Currency Group, Inc.

The Trust holds Bitcoins and, from time to time on a periodic basis, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of Bitcoins. As a passive investment vehicle, the Trust&#8217;s investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on Bitcoin per Share) to reflect the value of Bitcoins held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Index Price, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities. While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in Bitcoin, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to Bitcoin. To date, the Trust has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Bitcoins held by the Trust, less the Trust&#8217;s expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial. The Trust is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle. </p> <p style="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&#160;</p>

The Trust&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1)&#160;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Trust&#8217;s assets, (2)&#160;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trust&#8217;s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3)&#160;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trust&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trust&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31, 2022. In making this assessment, they used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013). Their assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trust&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on their assessment and those criteria, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31, 2022. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Marcum LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements as of and for the year ended December&#160;31, 2022 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in their report which is included herein, issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Trust&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&#160;31, 2022 on page F-2. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There was no change in the Trust&#8217;s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Trust&#8217;s most recently completed fiscal quarter ended December&#160;31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold" id="tx453116_14">Item&#160;9B. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Other Information</span> </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Not applicable. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold" id="tx453116_15">Item&#160;9C. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.</span> </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Not applicable. </p>

Additionally, the professional staff of the Sponsor also services other affiliates of the Trust, including several other digital asset investment vehicles, and their respective clients. Although the Sponsor and its professional staff cannot and will not devote all of its or their respective time or resources to the management of the affairs of the Trust, the Sponsor intends to devote, and to cause its professional staff to devote, sufficient time and resources to manage properly the affairs of the Trust consistent with its or their respective fiduciary duties to the Trust and others. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor and Grayscale Securities are affiliates of each other, and the Sponsor may engage other affiliated service providers in the future. Because of the Sponsor&#8217;s affiliated status, it may be disincentivized from replacing affiliated service providers. In connection with this conflict of interest, shareholders should understand that affiliated service providers will receive fees for providing services to the Trust. Clients of the affiliated service providers may pay commissions at negotiated rates which are greater or less than the rate paid by the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor and any affiliated service provider may, from time to time, have conflicting demands in respect of their obligations to the Trust and, in the future, to other clients. It is possible that future business ventures of the Sponsor and affiliated service providers may generate larger fees, resulting in increased payments to employees, and therefore, incentivizing the Sponsor and/or the affiliated service providers to allocate it/their limited resources accordingly to the potential detriment of the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is an absence of arm&#8217;s length negotiation with respect to some of the terms of the Trust, and, where applicable, there has been no independent due diligence conducted with respect to the Trust. The Sponsor will, however, not retain any affiliated service providers for the Trust which the Sponsor has reason to believe would knowingly or deliberately favor any other client over the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">The Authorized Participant </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to October&#160;3, 2022, Genesis, an affiliate of the Trust and the Sponsor, was the only Authorized Participant and was party to a participant agreement with the Sponsor and the Trust. Since October&#160;3, 2022, the only Authorized Participant is Grayscale Securities, an affiliate of the Trust and the Sponsor. As a result of this affiliation, the Sponsor has an incentive to resolve questions between Grayscale Securities, on the one hand, and the Trust and shareholders, on the other hand, in favor of Grayscale Securities (including, but not limited to, questions as to the calculation of the Basket Amount). Lastly, several employees of the Sponsor and Digital Currency Group, Inc. are FINRA-registered representatives who maintain their licenses through Grayscale Securities. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of the date of this Annual Report, Grayscale Securities has engaged Genesis, an affiliate of the Trust and the Sponsor, to act as its Liquidity Provider. In its capacity as the Liquidity Provider of Grayscale Securities, Genesis may engage in Bitcoin trading with the Trust&#8217;s affiliated entities. For example, when the Sponsor receives the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee in Bitcoins, it may sell the Bitcoins through Genesis. For this service, Genesis charges the Sponsor a transaction fee, which is not borne by the Trust. Additionally, the Sponsor&#8217;s parent company, Digital Currency Group, Inc., is the sole shareholder and parent company of Genesis, in addition to a customer of Genesis, and may buy or sell Bitcoins through Genesis from time to time, independent of the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">Proprietary Trading/Other Clients </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the officers of the Sponsor may trade Bitcoins for their own personal trading accounts (subject to certain internal trading policies and procedures) at the same time as they are managing the account of the Trust, the activities of the officers of the Sponsor, subject to their fiduciary duties, may, from time-to-time, result in their taking positions in their personal trading accounts which are opposite of the positions taken for the Trust. Records of the Sponsor&#8217;s officers&#8217; personal trading accounts will not be available for inspection by shareholders. </p> <p style="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:bold">The Index Provider </p> <p style="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Digital Currency Group, Inc. is the indirect parent company of the Index Provider. As a result, the Index Provider is an affiliate of the Sponsor and the Trust and has an incentive to resolve questions regarding, or changes to, the manner in which the Index is constructed and in which the Index Price is calculated in a way that favors the Sponsor and the Trust. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, Genesis, the only Liquidity Provider of the Authorized Participant as of the date hereof, licenses and uses a trading software platform provided by the Index Provider to operate its Bitcoin trading desk and to facilitate Genesis&#8217;s actions as Liquidity Provider of the Authorized Participant. Although the Index Provider does not currently utilize data from over-the-counter markets or derivative platforms, per the terms of the license, the Index Provider is entitled to use the over-the-counter trading data from Genesis in the Index. </p>

We involved professionals with specialized skills and knowledge in blockchain technology and digital assets and applied auditor judgment in determining the nature and extent of audit evidence required. We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over digital assets, including controls over the comparison of the Trust&#8217;s records of digital assets held to the custodial records. We evaluated the sufficiency of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls at the custodian, including the processes surrounding private key lifecycle management, the private key generation process, the storage of private keys and the authorization of digital asset transactions by evaluating subservice organization reports. We obtained confirmation from the custodian of the Trust&#8217;s digital assets as of December&#160;31, 2022 and compared the total digital assets confirmed to the Trust&#8217;s record of digital asset holdings. We also compared the Trust&#8217;s record of digital asset holdings to the records on the public blockchain using an audit software tool. We tested movements on the blockchain to evidence that the Trust controls the digital assets through the custodian account. We evaluated the sufficiency and appropriateness of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed over the digital assets. </div></div></div><div style="font-family: Times New Roman;

The Trust qualifies as an investment company for accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting and reporting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 946, Financial Services &#8211; Investment Companies. The Trust uses fair value as its method of accounting for Bitcoin in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material. </div></div> <div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">The Trust conducts its transactions in Bitcoin, including receiving Bitcoin for the creation of Shares and delivering Bitcoin for the redemption of Shares and for the payment of the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee. At this time, the Trust is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders.

ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for Bitcoin in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Trust to assume that Bitcoin is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;text-indent: 0px;;display:inline;"> </div><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;text-indent: 0px;;display:inline;"></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">The Trust only receives Bitcoin in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or its Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Trust looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Trust, through its Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant(s), may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets, each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, &#8220;Digital Asset Markets&#8221;). </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">In determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Trust&#8217;s principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order: </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"></div></div> <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 13.3333px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; float: none; display: inline !important; top: 0px;;display:inline;">First, the Trust reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that maintain practices and policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) and know-your-customer (&#8220;KYC&#8221;) regulations</div><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">, and non-Digital Asset Exchange Markets that the Trust reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">Second, the Trust sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of Bitcoin traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">Third, the Trust then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">Fourth, the Trust then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Trust, Exchange Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The Trust therefore looks to accessible Exchange Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, an Exchange Market has been selected as the Trust&#8217;s principal market. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">The Trust determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i)&#160;if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Market&#8217;s trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii)&#160;if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Trust has access to, or (iii)&#160;if recent changes to each Digital Asset Market&#8217;s price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trust&#8217;s determination of its principal market. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">The cost basis of Bitcoin received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Trust at the fair value of Bitcoin at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes.

The Trust creates (and, should the Trust commence a redemption program, redeems) Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets on behalf of investors are made by the Authorized Participant in exchange for the delivery of Bitcoin to the Trust or the distribution of Bitcoin by the Trust. The number of Bitcoin required for each creation Basket or redemption Basket is determined by dividing (x)&#160;the number of Bitcoin owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such trade date of a creation or redemption order, after deducting the number of Bitcoin representing the U.S. dollar value of accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust, by (y)&#160;the number of Shares outstanding at such time and multiplying the quotient obtained by 100. Each Share represented approximately <ix:nonFraction name="gbtc:CommonShareEquivalentOfBitcoin" contextRef="PAsOn12_01_2022" unitRef="Unit_shares" decimals="4" scale="0" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal">0.0009</ix:nonFraction> of one Bitcoin at both December&#160;31, 2022 and December&#160;31, 2021.

The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of each Share to investors. The Authorized Participant may realize significant profits buying, selling, creating, and, if permitted, redeeming Shares as a result of changes in the value of Shares or Bitcoin. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;;text-indent: 0px;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">Effective October&#160;28, 2014, the Trust suspended its redemption program, in which shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their Shares through Genesis, the sole Authorized Participant at the time out of concern that the redemption program was in violation of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, resulting in a settlement reached with the Securities Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). At this time, the Trust is not operating a redemption program and is not accepting redemption requests. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. On October&#160;19, 2021, NYSE Arca, Inc. (&#8220;NYSE Arca&#8221;) filed an application with the SEC pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act to list the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca. On June&#160;29, 2022, the SEC denied NYSE Arca&#8217;s 19b-4 application and the Sponsor subsequently petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for review of the SEC&#8217;s June&#160;29, 2022 final order denying approval to list shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product. The Sponsor&#8217;s petition remains pending. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"> </div></ix:nonNumeric> <ix:nonNumeric name="us-gaap:IncomeTaxDisclosureTextBlock" contextRef="P01_01_2022To12_31_2022" escape="true" continuedAt="TextSelection_67631834"><div style="font-weight:bold;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"></div></div> <div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-weight:bold;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">5.

On February&#160;9, 2017, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware ordered that the Original Trust Agreement be reformed so that the amendments made are retroactive to the original date of execution of the Trust Agreement. On September&#160;11, 2017, the Trust received a private letter ruling from the IRS in which the IRS concluded, based on the facts at that time, that the Trust qualified as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of the date of the private letter ruling. Furthermore, as of October&#160;24, 2017, amendments to the Trust Agreement were made to permit the Trust to hold rights to acquire, or otherwise establish, dominion and control over, Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency in a manner consistent with the Trust&#8217;s continued treatment as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">Accordingly, the Sponsor takes the position that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Rather, if the Trust is a grantor trust, each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated as directly owning its pro rata Share of the Trust&#8217;s assets and a pro rata portion of the Trust&#8217;s income, gain, losses and deductions will &#8220;flow through&#8221; to each beneficial owner of Shares. </div></div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;text-indent: 0px;;display:inline;">If the Trust were not properly classified as a grantor trust, the Trust might be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, due to the uncertain treatment of digital assets, including forks, airdrops and similar occurrences for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance in this regard. If the Trust were classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax consequences of owning Shares generally would not be materially different from the tax consequences described herein, although there might be certain differences, including with respect to timing. In addition, tax information reports provided to beneficial owners of Shares would be made in a different form. If the Trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be classified as a corporation for such purposes. In that event, the Trust would be subject to entity-level U.S. federal income tax (currently at the rate of<div style="letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">&#160;</div></div></div><ix:nonFraction name="us-gaap:EffectiveIncomeTaxRateReconciliationAtFederalStatutoryIncomeTaxRate" contextRef="P01_01_2022To12_31_2022" unitRef="Unit_pure" decimals="INF" scale="-2" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal">21</ix:nonFraction><div style="font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">%) on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trust&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits.</div></div></ix:nonNumeric> <div style="font-size: 8pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="font-size: 8pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">&#160;</div></div> <div style="text-align: center; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">F-11</div></div> <div style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 0em; page-break-before: always;"></div> </div> </div> <hr style="width: 100%; height: 3px; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"/> <div style="text-align: center;"> <div style="width: 8.5in; text-align: left; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"> <div style="font-size: 13.28px; margin-top: 1.67em; margin-bottom: 1.67em;;font-weight: bold;"><a href="#toc" style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: calc(-48.56vw + 48.9%);">Table of Contents</a></div> </div> </div> </div> <div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="width: 8.5in; text-align: left; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><ix:continuation id="TextSelection_67631834"> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">In accordance with GAAP, the Trust has defined the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; to be sustained by the applicable taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; threshold, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized.

The price of Bitcoin has a limited history. During such history, Bitcoin prices have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors, including the levels of liquidity. If Digital Asset Markets continue to experience significant price fluctuations, the Trust may experience losses. Several factors may affect the price of Bitcoin, including, but not limited to, global Bitcoin supply and demand, theft of Bitcoin from global exchanges or vaults, competition from other forms of digital currency or payment services, global or regional political, economic or financial conditions, and other unforeseen events and situations. </div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">The Bitcoin held by the Trust are commingled and the Trust&#8217;s shareholders have no specific rights to any specific Bitcoin.

There is a risk that some or all of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin could be lost or stolen. There can be no assurance that the Custodian will maintain adequate insurance or that such coverage will cover losses with respect to the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin. Further, transactions in Bitcoin are irrevocable. Stolen or incorrectly transferred Bitcoin may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed Bitcoin transactions could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. </div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">The SEC has stated that certain digital assets may be considered &#8220;securities&#8221; under the federal securities laws. The test for determining whether a particular digital asset is a &#8220;security&#8221; is complex and difficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Public, though non-binding, statements by senior officials at the SEC have indicated that the SEC did not consider Bitcoin or Ethereum to be securities, and does not currently consider Bitcoin to be a security. The SEC staff has also provided informal assurances to a handful of promoters that their digital assets are not securities. On the other hand, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against the issuers and promoters of several other digital assets on the basis that the digital assets in question are securities. </div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">If Bitcoin is determined to be a &#8220;security&#8221; under federal or state securities laws by the SEC or any other agency, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have material adverse consequences for Bitcoin. For example, it may become more difficult for Bitcoin to be traded, cleared and custodied as compared to other digital assets that are not considered to be securities, which could, in turn, negatively affect the liquidity and general acceptance of Bitcoin and cause users to migrate to other digital assets. As such, any determination that Bitcoin is a security under federal or state securities laws may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and, as a result, an investment in the Shares. </div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">To the extent that Bitcoin is determined to be a security, the Trust and the Sponsor may also be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including those under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Sponsor may be required to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. If the Sponsor determines not to comply with&#160;such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Sponsor will terminate the Trust. Any such termination could result in the liquidation of the Trust&#8217;s Bitcoin at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders. </div></div> <div style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><div style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 10pt; letter-spacing: 0px; top: 0px;;display:inline;">To the extent a private key required to access a Bitcoin address is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private keys are accessible, the Trust may be unable to access the Bitcoin controlled by the private key and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the Bitcoin Network.
