      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves lululemon athletica inc.LULU remains a formidable force in premium activewear, even as the broader market softens. In second-quarter fiscal 2025, the company reported earnings per share of $3.10, beating estimates, while revenues rose 6.5% year over year to $2.53 billion amid slowing U.S. demand. While international markets, especially China, continue to post double-digit gains, U.S. performance has stagnated due to weaker consumer spending and a saturated athleisure segment. Still, lululemon’s strong brand loyalty, with nearly 30 million members, underscores the company’s enduring consumer appeal.lululemon’s challenge lies in balancing innovation with relevance. Core casual lines such as Scuba and Softstreme have become “too predictable,” prompting plans to refresh designs and increase new styles from 23% to 35% by spring 2026. The company’s new creative leadership aims to restore momentum by accelerating its design cycle, leveraging its “Science of Feel” innovation platform, and introducing new collections like Loungeful and BeCalm. These moves highlight lululemon’s intent to stay ahead of competitors in both performance and lifestyle apparel.Despite near-term pressures from tariffs and higher costs, lululemon’s focus on innovation, agility and global expansion positions it for long-term resilience. The brand’s ability to command loyalty and consistently reinvent its offering may well enable it to outpace the slowdown and reaffirm its dominance in activewear’s evolving landscape. As the company strengthens its product pipeline and speeds up market responsiveness, it is laying the groundwork for a stronger rebound in 2026. Ultimately, lululemon’s blend of innovation, brand equity and global reach could ensure it remains the benchmark in the premium activewear industry. In the competitive athletic apparel and footwear market,NIKE Inc.NKE andUnder ArmourUAA are both powerful players striving to capture the attention of performance-driven consumers while adapting to shifting market dynamics.NIKE continues to dominate the global athleticwear market with its unmatched brand recognition, innovation and digital strength. Despite softer consumer demand in certain markets, the company’s strategic focus on direct-to-consumer sales and digital engagement has helped maintain its leadership position. NIKE’s deep investment in technology-driven personalization and sustainability through initiatives like its Nike App ecosystem and circular design programs has reinforced its emotional connection with consumers.Under Armour is working to regain its footing after years of inconsistent performance. The company’s recent focus on performance authenticity and core athletic wear has revitalized its brand identity, distancing it from overextension into fashion-oriented segments. Under Armour is emphasizing efficiency, inventory discipline and international expansion, especially in Europe and Asia, to drive steady growth. Its renewed product innovation, particularly in training and running categories, aims to reconnect with athletes seeking high-performance gear. lululemon’s shares have plunged 54.7% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 27.3%. From a valuation standpoint, LULU trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.32X, higher than the industry’s 11.68X. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for lululemon’s fiscal 2025 earnings implies a year-over-year decline of 11.9%, whereas the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 suggests growth of 1.12%. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2025 and 2026 have moved downward in the past 30 days.

      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/187301/is-nike-stocks-move-below-200-day-sma-a-warning-or-opportunity",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Shares ofNIKE Inc.NKE have lost momentum in recent months, pushing it below industry thresholds and portraying a bearish sentiment from a technical standpoint. As a result, the NKE stock slipped below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) yesterday. Notably, the stock closed at $68.91 on Oct. 8, 2025, moving below the 200-day SMA of $69.13.A drop below the 200-day SMA typically signals weakness, suggesting a shift from long-term bullish to bearish sentiment. It highlights fading investor confidence and slower buying interest, especially after months of underperformance.Additionally, the sportswear behemoth sloped below its 50-day SMA on Sept. 5, 2025, and continues to trade below the mark since then, indicating a short-term downward trend.SMA is an essential tool in technical analysis that helps investors evaluate price trends by smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This approach also provides a clearer perspective on a stock's long-term direction. NIKE has shown a lackluster performance, with its shares losing 6.3% in the past three months compared with the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry’s decline of 2.5%. The NKE stock has also underperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s fall of 1.8% and the S&P 500's growth of 9.3% in the same period.NKE’s performance is notably weaker than that of its competitors,Wolverine World WideWWW andSteven MaddenSHOO, which have rallied 29% and 30.2%, respectively, in the past three months. However, the NKE stock has outperformedadidas AG’s ADDYY decline of 12.8% in the same period. At its current price of $68.91, the NKE stock trades 31.8% above its 52-week low mark of $52.28 and 18.7% below its 52-week high mark of $84.76. NIKE’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 results underscored the depth of its ongoing transition, as the company navigates a strategic reset amid weakening consumer demand and intensified competition. The “Win Now” strategy, aimed at rebalancing the product mix away from aging classics like Air Force 1, Dunk and Jordan 1 toward innovation-led performance products, continues to weigh on near-term results. This portfolio shift, while strategically sound, has created a multibillion-dollar revenue headwind as NIKE clears aged inventory through value channels to restore full-price momentum.In the fiscal first quarter, revenue declines were particularly pronounced in North America and Greater China, both critical markets under pressure from promotional activity, macroeconomic softness and local brand competition. Digital traffic fell in the double-digits in the fiscal first quarter as NIKE repositioned its online platforms toward premium, full-price offerings. The gross margin contracted further, reflecting elevated discounting, channel mix headwinds and the early impacts of newly imposed U.S. tariffs on China-sourced footwear.Meanwhile, SG&A expenses rose due to sustained investment in demand creation and marketplace activations, limiting operating leverage. Management emphasized that these elevated costs are vital to reigniting brand energy and strengthening wholesale relationships, even at the expense of short-term profitability. Despite ongoing softness in lifestyle franchises and cautious consumer spending, bright spots emerged in performance categories like Running and Global Football.Overall, NIKE’s dismal quarter reflects deliberate short-term pain for long-term gain. By resetting its marketplace, restoring pricing power and focusing on sport-led innovation, NIKE aims to rebuild sustainable growth momentum beyond fiscal 2026. While NIKE remains fundamentally strong, backed by its decisive actions to reposition itself for sustainable and profitable long-term growth, its current forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 34.64X raises concerns about whether the stock's valuation is justified. This multiple is higher than the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry average of 29.76X and the S&P 500’s average of 23.65X, making the stock appear relatively expensive.At 34.64X P/E, the Swoosh brand owner is trading at a much higher valuation than its competitors. Its peers, such as Wolverine, Steven Madden and adidas, are delivering solid growth and trade at more reasonable multiples. Wolverine, Steven Madden and adidas have forward 12-month P/E ratios of 16.45X, 18.84X and 19.41X — all significantly lower than NIKE. At such levels, NKE’s valuation seems out of step with its growth trajectory, especially given the recent decline in its stock price. The stock's elevated valuation reflects high investor expectations for growth. However, NIKE looks increasingly vulnerable in an environment wherein market participants are growing cautious about overpriced Consumer Discretionary stocks. The company’s ability to meet or exceed these lofty expectations is crucial in justifying its premium pricing. Despite near-term turbulence, NIKE’s underlying fundamentals remain resilient. The company continues to leverage its global scale, powerful brand equity and innovation engine to navigate a period of strategic reset. Management’s disciplined approach, managing down aged franchises, streamlining inventory and refocusing on performance-led products, reflects a long-term vision centered on restoring pricing power and profitability. Growth in key categories like Running, Global Football and Women’s underscores NIKE’s ability to reignite consumer engagement through sport and innovation.NIKE retains strong balance sheet flexibility and operational discipline to absorb short-term shocks. While margins remain under pressure from promotional activity, tariffs and elevated SG&A, the company is positioning itself for healthier growth through cleaner inventories, improved product freshness and expanded wholesale partnerships. As the product pipeline strengthens and demand creation investments take hold, NIKE’s structural advantages may drive a durable rebound once market conditions stabilize. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIKE’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 EPS moved up 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively, in the last 30 days. For fiscal 2026, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NKE’s revenues implies 0.2% year-over-year growth, while the estimate for EPS suggests a 23.2% decline. The consensus mark for fiscal 2027 revenues and earnings indicates 5.7% and 56.4% year-over-year growth, respectively. NIKE’s stock currently reflects a delicate balance between optimism about its long-term strategic reset and skepticism about its near-term execution risks. While management’s focus on innovation, cleaner inventories and a performance-driven product mix lays the groundwork for sustainable growth, the company’s short-term outlook remains clouded by soft consumer demand, margin pressure and elevated valuation levels. Trading below both its 50 and 200-day moving averages, NKE continues to exhibit bearish technical momentum, suggesting investor sentiment remains cautious.Given its premium forward P/E multiple, significantly higher than peers, NIKE appears richly valued relative to its earnings trajectory. Although fundamentals such as brand equity and balance sheet strength provide support, the lack of near-term growth visibility tempers the bullish case. For now, investors may be better served by waiting for signs of revenue stabilization and margin recovery before taking a fresh position, as the stock is likely to remain range-bound in the near term.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Nike's earnings have continued to slide due to the impact of tariffs and product discounts. As long as the company’s brand name remains strong, Nike will maintain an advantage. Despite being a leader in the global sportswear market,Nike(NYSE: NKE)has made it extremely easy for investors to be bearish about its business lately. In the past five years, its share price has tanked by 43% (as of Oct. 3). Nike now trades 59% below the record high it set in November 2021. Contrarian investorsmight view this as an opening to put some money to work. But is this consumer discretionary stock a brilliant buying opportunity over the next five years? There are legitimate arguments on both sides of the question. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Over the past several quarters, Nike's revenue has been under immense pressure. Investors just got a glimmer of hope, though. On Sept. 30, the company reported financial results for itsfiscal 2026 first quarter(which ended Aug. 31), and they could be signaling that the company's worst days are in the past. It was encouraging that revenue increased 1% year over year to $11.7 billion, coming in better than Wall Street expected.And it was great to see sales in North America grow by 4%. Other wins occurred in the wholesale segment, where revenue rose by 7%, and sales for Nike Running were up 20% as the business fought to regain some of themarket shareit had previously lost to rivals. However, diluted earnings per share (EPS) declined by 30% year over year. Nike has been clearing out older inventory, which has resulted in more sales of discounted merchandise, which has hurt its margins. It also won't help that the new U.S. tariffs are expected to boost the company's costs by $1.5 billion this fiscal year alone. Investors should be cautiously optimistic about how Nike will fare in the upcoming holiday shopping season. The Federal Reserve has started to cut interest rates, embarking on a more accommodative path ofmonetary policy. This could lead to stronger consumer confidence and a boost in consumer spending. But Nike isn't in the clear just yet. \"We expect Q2 revenues to be down low single digits,\" said CFO Matt Friend on the fiscal Q1 earnings call. Nike's most important asset is itsbrand name. A decades-long track record for producing popular apparel and footwear, coupled with influential marketing campaigns and endorsements from high-profile athletes, has lifted the brand into an enviable position. Recently, Nike has faced weakening demand due to lackluster product innovations and intense competition. However, given the brand's global recognition, broad distribution, and its unmatched relationships with top sports leagues and athletes, it will always be top-of-mind for consumers. This gives Nike a solid foundation to operate from. If it veers off track (as it has), the leadership team can leverage the power of the brand in its efforts to get the company back on course. As mentioned, Nike is trading well off its peak. However, itsprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.9 doesn't entirely reflect that this is a challenged business. Perhaps that shows that valuing it now based on its diluted EPS figure is not the right approach, as the bottom line has been negatively impacted by the company's struggles. If Nike'snet profit marginwas currently at its 10-year average of 10%, it would have diluted earnings of about $3.12 per share. Based on that normalized figure, the stock's P/E ratio would be a much cheaper 23. This setup could be enticing for prospective investors looking to bet on a turnaround play. However, investing in Nike today still seems like a risky move because it could be a while until the company's earnings start to grow at a healthy clip. Should things work out well, the upside over the next five years from today's starting point could be significant. But Nike stock isn't a brilliant opportunity based on the reality of the business right now.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Although Nike (currently trading at $69.05 per share) has gained 29.6% over the last six months, it has trailed the S&P 500’s 34.7% return during that period. This may have investors wondering how to approach the situation. Is now the time to buy Nike, or should you be careful about including it in your portfolio?Dive into our full research report to see our analyst team’s opinion, it’s free for active Edge members. We don't have much confidence in Nike. Here are three reasons we avoid NKE and a stock we'd rather own. We can better understand Footwear companies by analyzing their constant currency revenue. This metric excludes currency movements, which are outside of Nike’s control and are not indicative of underlying demand. Over the last two years, Nike’s constant currency revenue averaged 4.8% year-on-year declines. This performance was underwhelming and implies there may be increasing competition or market saturation. It also suggests Nike might have to lower prices or invest in product improvements to accelerate growth, factors that can hinder near-term profitability. Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king. Over the next year, analysts predict Nike’s cash conversion will fall. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 6.5% for the last 12 months will decrease to 1.7%. A company’s ROIC, or return on invested capital, shows how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity). We like to invest in businesses with high returns, but thetrendin a company’s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Nike’s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities. Nike doesn’t pass our quality test. With its shares trailing the market in recent months, the stock trades at 36.7× forward P/E (or $69.05 per share). At this valuation, there’s a lot of good news priced in - you can find more timely opportunities elsewhere. Let us point you towardan all-weather company that owns household favorite Taco Bell.

But could investing in thisconsumer discretionary stockmake you a millionaire? Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Nike was founded in 1964 by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, who innovated with running shoes. Over the next six decades, the company has become a global icon in the world of sports apparel and footwear. Today, itcommands a leading positionof 16% of the sportswear market, according to data from Euromonitor. One of Nike's core competencies is its ability to design and develop clothes and shoes that cater to athletes in a variety of sports. Nike also targets regular consumers, more so with its lifestyle-inspired merchandise. Another key strength, which is no surprise, is Nike's marketing prowess. There are few companies on Earth that have this kind of expertise when it comes to resonating with consumers everywhere. Nike does a wonderful job at storytelling that inspires people. It helps that the business spent $1.2 billion on demand creation expense (its term for marketing costs) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 (ended Aug. 31), equating to 10% of revenue, part of which goes to its notable endorsement deals that raise the brand's visibility. This is one of the world's most recognizable brands today. This gives the business a differentiation factor that separates it from others in the industry. And it supports Nike's pricing power, allowing it to earn agross marginin excess of 40% on a consistent basis for what some might view as commoditized products in apparel and footwear. Over an extended period of time, a company's fundamentals are the critical factor that drive shareholder returns. To be more specific, it comes down to earnings growth. Recently, Nike has struggled mightily in this regard, due to strategic missteps. The previous CEO pushed too aggressively toward e-commerce sales and away from wholesale accounts. Nike also leaned too much on its lifestyle products. The company is trying to turn things around under new leadership. CEO Elliot Hill's Win Now strategy's first task aligned the business with a greater focus on sports, branding, and fixing distribution, while bringing back a focus on product innovation to drum up excitement from consumers. Nike's sales were up 1% in Q1, ending a streak of five straight quarters of declines. It's hard to overstate how important Nike's global presence, scale, and distribution are. It can sell its products anywhere, and it has a loyal customer base. And as mentioned, the brand provides an advantage. However, the company'snet incomedropped an alarming 31% in the first quarter. And the profit figure of $727 million was half of the total three years before. Ongoing promotional activity, coupled with an expected $1.5 billion added expense fromtariffs, won't make it easy to boost the bottom line. And that can pressure shares. Investors who make a $10,000 investment in the stock need to see a monster 100-fold gain in order to reach millionaire status. In the past 30 years, shares have produced a total return of 2,750% (as of Oct. 3). For what it's worth, this comes up well ahead of theS&P 500performance. Had you purchased $10,000 worth of Nike stock in October 1995, you'd have $285,000 today. This happened during a stretch when the company registered tremendous growth. There's a virtual certainty that Nike's earnings growth over the next three decades won't even come close to what it achieved in the past 30 years. This gives me a firm belief that Nike won't make you a millionaire starting from a $10,000 investment. It probably won't even come close. This is a much more mature business today, so don't expect game-changing long-term returns.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Nike(NYSE: NKE)gained a quick 6% after reporting fiscal Q1 2026 earnings. The sportswear Goliath is in the process of trying to reinvigorate top-line growth after a tough fiscal 2025. The fiscal first quarter showed an improvement in revenue, but not by much. Despite better results, this still might not be time to hop back on the Nike train. There's still plenty of work to be done here. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » On the surface, Nike managed to eke out $11.7 billion inrevenuefor Q1, a 1% reported gain over last year. But that headline hides a more nuanced picture. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue was actually down about 1%. Digging deeper, the split between its Direct and Wholesale channels tells a story of divergence. Nike Direct (which includes Nike's own digital sales and owned retail) declined 4% reported and 5% on a currency-neutral basis. In contrast, the wholesale business delivered 7% growth (5% ex-currency) to $6.8 billion. That suggests Nike is leaning more heavily on third-party partners and perhaps recalibrating its direct efforts. Regionally, Nike saw strength in North America, where footwear held flat and apparel jumped 11%. But weakness in Greater China dragged. Total China revenues fell 9% (or 10% ex-currency changes), particularly in footwear, which was down 11% and equipment, which declined 32%. The modest top-line gain is propped up by wholesale strength and selective regional pockets. But Nike will need to stem declines in China and reinvigorate its Direct channel if it wants more balance and resilience. Revenue alone isn't enough. Profits are what matter at the end of the day, and Nike's profits slid sharply this past quarter. Net income dropped 31%, and diluted EPS fell from $0.70 to $0.49 per share, a 30% decline. Why? Margins took a beating. Gross margin contracted by 320 basis points to 42.2%, largely due to increased discounting, less favorable channel mix, and elevated tariff pressures in North America. Meanwhile, operating expenses held relatively steady. Selling and general and administrative costs edged down 1%, but weren't enough to offset the margin slide. Another drag was taxes. Nike's effective tax rate climbed to 21.1% versus 19.6% a year ago, due to reduced benefits from stock-based compensation. Earnings are under real stress. For Nike to restore investor confidence, future quarters will need margin stabilization, and not just revenue growth. Despite the headwinds, Nike continues to return capital to shareholders. In Q1, it paid $591 million in dividends (a 6% increase year over year) and bought back $123 million of shares (retiring 1.8 million shares). You can also point to Nike's long history of dividend growth. It has had 23 consecutive years of increases. And it's in the midst of an $18 billion share repurchase authorization, with 124.4 million shares already repurchased to date. That said, the ability to sustainbuybacksand dividends could come under pressure if earnings remain weak or capital is needed for more aggressive investments in digital, supply chain, or product innovation. Nike's cash and equivalents fell to about $8.6 billion, down from a year ago. The capital return policy is a differentiator and helps support the valuation, but it's not immune to stress. Investors should watch how aggressive Nike remains if margins or cash generation are challenged. Nike'sQ1 earnings show a company in transition. On one hand, wholesale growth and continued capital returns offer some ballast. On the other, weakness in China, a declining Direct channel, and sharp margin erosion raise red flags for the path ahead. Looking to the holidays, things seem like they will continue to be weak. The company noted that it expects the secondfiscal quarter, which includes much of the holiday season, to be \"sluggish.\" CNBC noted that the company expects sales to decline by a low-single-digit percentage, so we're likely not going to see the fruits of the attempted turnaround until next year. For investors, the next few quarters are critical. Can Nike right the margin ship? Can it reinvigorate direct sales? These are questions that could weigh on the stock in coming quarters if not addressed. If it can navigate those, the long-term story remains intact, but there might not be much room for error in terms of the stock's performance. It has significantly underperformed theS&P 500, and is in an increasingly competitive and volatile retail landscape. To consider the company's lower price a buying opportunity, you really have to believe in the ability to make long-term gains from here. On Nike's website, they go so far as to call themselves a growth company. Given the maturity and size of the business, I'm not sure if that is still the case.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves NIKE Inc.NKE, the global sportswear leader, is navigating fresh challenges as newly imposed reciprocal tariffs add an estimated $1.5 billion in annual costs, a sharp increase from the $1 billion projected just 90 days earlier. These tariffs come at a pivotal moment when the company is rebuilding momentum through its “Win Now” and “Sport Offense” strategies.Despite delivering first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings above expectations, NIKE’s gross margins declined 320 basis points (bps) to 42.2% in first-quarter fiscal 2026, partly due to increased product costs and tariff-related headwinds. This rising cost pressure threatens to squeeze profitability just as the brand begins to regain traction in key markets like North America and Europe.To protect margins, NIKE is aggressively deploying cost-control and pricing strategies. Management highlighted several mitigation efforts, including leveraging the company’s global scale, supply chain expertise and selective pricing adjustments.NIKE is also rebalancing its channel mix by shifting focus toward wholesale partners and premium full-price sales, while reducing dependence on discount-driven digital traffic. These actions are crucial as the company faces an estimated 120 bps drag on gross margin in fiscal 2026 due to tariff costs alone. However, management remains confident that the “Win Now” playbook focusing on cleaner inventories, innovation-driven product lines and higher full-price realization will gradually offset these macroeconomic pressures.NIKE’s ability to sustain consumer loyalty may prove just as vital as protecting margins. The brand’s strength lies in its deep emotional connection with athletes and consumers worldwide. By doubling down on performance categories like running, basketball and football, where demand and storytelling remain strong, NIKE aims to keep consumers engaged even amid potential price adjustments. While tariffs present a formidable cost challenge, the company’s mix of brand equity, innovation and disciplined execution could help it maintain both profitability and the trust of its global consumer base. adidas AGADDYY andlululemon athletica inc.LULU are the key companies competing with NIKE in the global market.adidas continues to strengthen its global presence through innovation, digital expansion and strategic brand positioning. Following a period of restructuring and supply chain challenges, the company is refocusing on its core performance categories — running, football and lifestyle — with renewed emphasis on high-margin products and regional growth opportunities. adidas’ “Own the Game” strategy aims to drive sustainable growth by enhancing direct-to-consumer sales and expanding digital engagement. The company is working to rebuild momentum, especially in North America and China, through sharper product innovation and a more disciplined go-to-market approach.lululemon has evolved from a niche yoga apparel company into a global premium performance lifestyle brand. The company continues to outperform peers with its focus on innovation, product quality and experiential retail. lululemon's “Power of Three ×2” growth plan emphasizes product diversification, digital expansion and international growth, particularly in menswear and footwear. As the brand continues to blend athletic performance with lifestyle appeal, its commitment to technical fabrics, wellness culture and personalized engagement positions it as a formidable challenger in the global athletic wear market. Shares of NIKE have lost 4.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 7%. From a valuation standpoint, NKE trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.25X compared with the industry’s average of 30.12X. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NKE’s fiscal 2026 earnings implies a year-over-year decline of 23.2%, while that for fiscal 2027 indicates growth of 56.4%.

I thought that this was a, this conference call was a orchestration. It was kind of like what we used to get Mark Parker, the great former CEO. I thought that this was one of the best most encouraging conference calls of the year. Elliott Hill does,  I want everyone to read it, because he has this great arc in it, David. . .he talked about the British win in women’s global football.

Expectations were low coming intoNike's(NYSE: NKE)fiscal first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday. The Swoosh had promised an improvement after revenue in its previous quarter tumbled 10%, but it still expected a decline. Nike's problems have been clear for some time. Under previous CEO John Donahoe, the company got away from its roots, neglecting its wholesale partners, not innovating in new products, and ignoring the kind of brand marketing that has made Nike one of the best-known logos in the world. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » CEO Elliott Hill has now been in the hot seat for about a year, attempting to reestablish relationships with key retail partners like Foot Locker, clear out excess inventory in classic franchises like Dunks, and get back to innovating performance products that resonate with athletes. The results from its first-quarter earnings report show those efforts seem to be paying off faster than expected. Revenue in the quarter rose 1% to $11.7 billion, which crushed the consensus of $10.99 billion, or down 5.2%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue was down 1%, but that was still much better than expectations. Gross margindeclined 320 basis points to 42.2%, reflecting higher discounts in both the wholesale and direct channels and a shift back to the wholesale channel, which tends to be a lower gross margin. The margin decline seems to indicate more efforts to clearinventory, which fell 2% in the quarter to $8.1 billion, a positive sign. On the bottom line, earnings per share were down 30% to $0.49, largely due to the decline in gross margin, though that still easily beat the consensus estimate of $0.27. While the sharp decline in profits is concerning, Nike seems to be ahead of where it expected to be at this point in itsturnaround, and it's making progress in key areas. Its efforts to revamp its running business continue to pay off as the company responded to three things that customers said they wanted in a running shoe: cushioning, stability, and an everyday shoe that returns energy. In response, it redesigned top-selling styles like Vomero, Structure, and Pegasus, and the customer response was clear. Nike running sales grew by more than 20% in the quarter. It's experimenting with running-only stores, saying that it redesigned a store in Austin to focus only on running and training, driving significant sales growth. Nike has also undergone an impressive reversal in North America, which it sees as driving growth in the overall business, and where the bulk of Hill's efforts have been thus far. Sales in that region went from an 11% decline in the fiscal fourth quarter to 4% growth in the first quarter, benefiting from the tailwinds in the running business and efforts to expand its reach to new partners likeAmazon, as wholesale revenue grew by 11%. In addition to the strength in running, training and basketball were up double digits, while its classic footwear franchises were down 30% as the company deemphasizes them. Management still indicates the turnaround will take time as it struggles in regions like China, and it forecast a decline in Nike Direct sales for the fiscal year as it focuses on the wholesale channel. For the second quarter, management expects similar trends, including a low-single-digit decline in revenue and gross margins falling 300-375 basis points, which includes a net headwind of 175basis pointsfrom new tariffs. Due to increasedtariffs, The company now estimates a $1.5 billion incremental cost this year, up from a previous target of $1 billion. Nike management is clearly indicating that investors need to be patient with the recovery, but there are clear signs of progress here, and at least some of the headwinds, like tariffs, are one-time in nature. Getting the right inventory balance and clearing out classic franchises will take time, but Hill's strategy appears to be working. Nike stock isn't cheap, a sign that investors have some confidence in the turnaround, but there's still a lot of upside if the company can get back to peak performance.

Its two largest regions, North America and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), have been a drag on the company, with North America seeing a 9% decline in revenue last fiscal year and EMEA a 10% decrease. However, both regions posted positive sales in fiscal Q1. North America revenue rose 4% in the quarter to $5 billion, with apparel sales climbing 11% and footwear revenue flat. EMEA sales jumped 6%, although they were up just 1% inconstant currencies, with apparel sales up 11% and footwear revenue rising 4%. The company said in North America that it saw double-digit growth in running, training, and basketball, but that was largely offset by a 30% decline in its classic footwear franchises. EMEA saw some similar trends with double-digit growth in running but a decline in classic footwear. One of CEO Elliott Hill's goals since taking over has been working to improve wholesale relationships, and that appeared to pay off in the quarter. Overall, wholesale revenue grew 5%, and climbed 11% in North America and 4% in EMEA. Nike Direct sales, however, were lower in both regions. In North America, Nike Direct sales fell 3%, with Nike Digital revenue falling 10% and flat sales at its stores. EMEA was a similar story, with Nike Direct revenue down 6%. Digital sales sank 13%, while store revenue edged up 1%. Nike stated that its EMEA region is closest to achieving a full-price business model for Nike Direct, while North America is leading the transformation efforts for future growth. While North America and EMEA saw solid sales growth, China remained a drag, with revenue falling 9%. The company said both store traffic and sell-through were headwinds. Nike Direct sales dropped 12%, with digital sales plunging 27%, while wholesale revenue sank 9%. Asia Pacific and Latin America sales, meanwhile, rose by 2%. Nike continues to discount to clear inventory, which, together withtariffs,is weighing on itsgross marginsand profits. Gross margins fell 320 basis points to 42.2%, while itsearnings per share (EPS)sank 30% in the quarter to $0.49. Looking ahead, Nike issued cautious guidance. It said tariffs would be a significant cost headwind, upping its original projection from a $1 billion impact to $1.5 billion. As a result, it now expects the impact to hurt gross margins by 120 basis points, up from an earlier outlook of 75 basis points. For fiscal Q2, Nike is looking for revenue to decline by low single digits, with a gross margin decline of between 300 basis points and 375 basis points. Tariffs will be a 175 basis point headwind in the quarter. Nike showed some solid progress this quarter, particularly in North America, as its wholesale business posted a nice improvement. However, this quarter also showed how far the company needs to go to really get back on track. Nike Direct remains a drag, and the company does not expect it to return to growth this year. It's working to make its stores and digital platform premium destinations, but it still has a lot of work to do to achieve this transition. Meanwhile, tariffs continue to be a headwind, and its classic footwear business and China remain a drag. These are multiple issues the company is trying to remedy. As Nike's earnings power has faded, it's left the stock with a pretty high valuation. The stock now trades at aforward price-to-earnings (P/E)ratio of around 44 times analysts' fiscal 2026 estimates. The company needs to get back to selling more full-price merchandise to lift sales and gross margins, which will drive earnings. However, that will take time, and tariffs add another obstacle to its recovery.

Cramer highlighted that the stock is being added to the Charitable Trust portfolio. He said: “Overall, I thought this quarter was a major step forward, and clearly buyers agreed, because the stock really roared today. Okay, that said, let me throw some cold water on what I’m saying. Turnarounds take a long time. This is really just the beginning… And look, Nike’s definitely still has a lot of room for improvement… Beyond the company’s specific challenges, Nike has to contend with a major industry headwind, and that’s, as you probably guessed, tariffs… So here’s the bottom line: After last night’s earnings report, I feel a lot more confident in Nike’s ability to turn itself around, which is why we’re adding to our position in this one for the Charitable Trust this very morning. In a very tough environment, Nike’s doing great things to the power of competent leadership. I like that. In short, Elliott Hill is a gamer, a lover of sport, and a person who respects his customers while revering the institution that is Nike. He knows they need to reconnect, and it’ll be hard work. But with him at the helm, I’m betting a $74 stock can go to $100.” NIKE, Inc.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Nike’s (NYSE: NKE)turnaround has been brewing for several quarters and may now be at hand. The FQ1 report revealed green shoots despite ongoing headwinds and aligns with an outlook for additional improvement, a return to growth, and a rebound in share prices. The question is whether the rebound is sustainable and if the stock is a good buy in October. Nike’s Win Now plan has the business returning to its roots. The plan focuses on the core markets: North America, wholesale, and Running. The green shoots are most visible in the product mix, which includes a 7% increase in wholesale sales offset by a 4% decline in direct sales. The only bad news is that wholesales come with narrower margins, as also seen in the report; however, this is a more sustainable margin and one sufficient to sustainfinancial health and capital returns. Capital returns in 2025 include a 2.3% dividend yield, a positive outlook for distribution growth, and share buybacks. Nike hada decent Q1with revenue growing by nearly 1.0% and outpacing MarketBeat’s reported consensus by 650 basis points. Thestrength was driven by the core Nike brand, which grew by 2% to offset a 27% contraction in Converse sales. Converse sales were reported to be weak across all markets. Nike brand sales were mixed, but footwear sales declined by only 1%, offset by a 9% increase in Apparel and a 4% gain in Equipment. xed, with the gross margin contracting by more than 300 basis points. The offsets include the impact of discounts and tariffs, as well as the channel mix, and an expectation for margin recovery over time. The net result is adjusted EPS of 49 cents, which nearly doubles the consensus target, and optimistic guidance that may be viewed as ultra-cautious. The company is forecasting a revenue decline for Q2, cautioning that its revenue, margins, and regional strengths will recover at different paces, resulting in a lumpy recovery on its path to 20% running-business growth. Theanalyst sentiment trendsalign with Nike’sbottoming process. The group of 33 tracked by MarketBeat rates the stock as a Moderate Buy with bullish bias. The bullish bias is significant, with 70% of the ratings pegged as Buy, no sell ratings, and sentiment firming over the past two quarters. The consensus price target is also significant, rising in early October after having trended lower for several quarters, indicating a rebound in sentiment is underway. The first revisions tracked by MarketBeatalign with the rebound, including comments to the effect that the Q1 report is a relief, showing strengths in key areas, with positives outweighing the negatives. The consensus is that this company is on track to regain business momentum and create shareholder value over time. Keybanc analyst Randal Konik says the firm would aggressively buy at early October valuations. Institutions are likewise buying aggressively, accumulating shares at a pace of approximately $2 to $1 versus sellers in each of the first three quarters of 2025. Nike’s 2025price action aligns with a market bottom. The stock price advanced by 5% following the FQ1 earnings release and is on track to retest long-term highs soon. A move to new highs aligns with a Head & Shoulders pattern, creating the second shoulder, setting the market up for a move to new highs. In this scenario, the NKE stock price could advance to the $90 range by year’s end and potentially rise higher over the longer term as turnaround efforts gain momentum.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Nike(NYSE: NKE)is starting to show signs of a rebound. The athletic apparel giant -- whose portfolio includes Nike, Jordan, and Converse -- this week reported a small return to revenue growth in its first quarter of fiscal 2026 after several tough periods. Shares have bounced off their lows in recent months as investors warm to the new leadership team's turnaround playbook. The question is whether the latest results and ensuing stock move mark an attractive entry point. There is clear progress in core sport categories and wholesale, yet competitive intensity and margin headwinds remain a real concern. Making matters worse for investors, shares aren't necessarily cheap in the context of the company's recent performance. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor.See the stocks » The most important takeaway in Nike'sfiscalfirst-quarter update was simple:Revenuereturned to growth. In the quarter ended Aug. 31, revenue rose 1% to about $11.7 billion, with management noting wholesale growth and strength in running, training, and basketball. North America revenue increased 4% as wholesale orders improved, while Nike Direct declined as the company continued to lean away from promotions in its digital channels. But context is key here. Sales growth was accompanied by pain on the bottom line. Management called out heavier discounting in factory stores, a still-promotional digital environment, andgross margincompression. Reported gross margin fell 320 basis points to 42.2%, reflecting discounting, channel mix, and higher product costs -- including newly implemented \"reciprocal tariffs\" that management now estimates will add roughly $1.5 billion in annualized costs. All of this translated into a 30% year-over-year decrease in earnings per share. Geographically, the recovery is uneven. Greater China remained soft, with revenue down 10% year over year, as traffic and sell-through lagged despite pockets of product momentum. But wholesale order books for spring are up year over year, and running delivered strong growth globally. Given the continued challenges the company is facing in some areas of its business, Nike guided for a low-single-digit revenue decline in the second quarter as it accelerates demand creation and continues to rebalance channels. \"Progress won't be perfectly linear, but the direction is,\" Nike CEO Elliott Hill said in the prepared remarks of the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings call. For investors, the crux is valuation versus progress. As of this writing, Nike'smarket capwas about $108 billion, giving the stock aprice-to-earnings ratioin the low 30s -- a premium that arguably assumes a steadier path back to mid-teens earnings growth. That premium, of course, could prove justified if the turnaround accelerates. Nike is leaning back into its core performance categories like running, training, and basketball -- areas where it still commands strong consumer loyalty. At the same time, wholesale relationships are improving, inventories are healthier, and the brand's global scale remains unmatched. First, the margin backdrop could stay choppy. Nike expects another quarter of year-over-year gross margin pressure as tariffs ramp and as it invests more aggressively in marketing to reignite demand. Additionally, management's forecast for an annualized tariff impactrun rateof $1.5 billion is $500 million higher than it was 90 days ago. This will be a meaningful hit that will take time to offset with pricing, sourcing shifts, and mix. Second, the recovery is uneven across regions and channels. Making matters worse, management doesn't expect Nike Direct to return to growth this fiscal year, and Greater China will \"require more time\" given promotional dynamics and weaker traffic. Ultimately, when growth relies more on wholesale in the near term, profitability can be more sensitive to discounting and partner health. Given enough time, these are fixable issues, but they reinforce that the comeback won't be a straight line. Stepping back, Nike has clearly moved from triage to rebuilding. Revenue is no longer falling (for now), core performance categories are gaining traction, and wholesale momentum is improving. Shareholders, therefore, can take heart that the plan is working. But for prospective buyers, the stock's price-to-earnings multiple in the low 30s may not be compelling enough with margins compressing and the company forecasting another revenue decline in fiscal Q2. Investors interested in owning Nike shares may want to wait for either clearer evidence of sustained margin recovery and reacceleration -- or for a better price that more fully acknowledges the competitive and cost headwinds Nike still faces.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Lululemon Athletica has lost more than half of its value this year alone as trade uncertainty weighs on its stock. Nike is in the early innings of a transition, since its new CEO took over nearly a year ago. Lululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU)andNike(NYSE: NKE)are two iconic, well-known apparel brands. They're popular with young consumers, and many buyers stick with the brands for years. In recent years, however, they've encountered significant challenges. Both stocks are down 44% over the past five years. Nike has been on a more steady decline, whereas Lululemon's stock has recently been in a free fall. Which of these beaten-down stocks are you better off taking a chance on today? Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Lululemon has been a faster-growing stock in recent years than Nike. It's facing some headwinds right now, but they're arguably temporary ones. The biggest ones are undoubtedly its exposure totariffsand its dependence on a strong Chinese market. Of the $4.9 billion in revenue the company has generated through the first half of the year, more than 17% of that came from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. It also imports a lot of products from that part of the world, which means that any trade wars involving the U.S. and China could result in Lululemon's business getting hit heavily on both its top and bottom lines. But if you believe these headwinds are temporary and trade issues will sort themselves out in the longer term, then Lululemon could be an intriguing buy right now. It has lost more than half of its value since the start of the year, and it trades at aforward price-to-earnings (P/E) multipleof 14, which factors in analyst expectations for how the company will perform in the year ahead. And itsprice-to-earnings-growth multipleis just under 1, which also signifies that the stock is cheap when compared to its longer-term growth potential. It wasn't that long ago that the business was growing at a fast rate. In the fiscal year ended Feb. 2, 2025, the company's revenue totaled $10.6 billion, which was up 10% from the previous year, a 31% increase from the $8.1 billion it posted two years earlier. Lululemon's growth is likely to slow in the near term, but with a strong brand, it can recover over the long haul. Nike is the big dog in theapparel industry, and it's in the midst of a turnaround under new CEO Elliott Hill, who is looking to rebuild the company's relationships with trusted partners and retailers. It was almost a year ago that he took over, so it's probably too early to declare his strategy a success or failure thus far. But there's reason to be optimistic, as the company's iconic products are known throughout the world, and few brands are as recognizable as the Nike swoosh. Nike's business also has the advantage of being moreglobalin nature than Lululemon's. While Greater China is a key market for Nike, that segment accounted for 14% of Nike's revenue in its most recent fiscal year, which ended May 31. The company generated nearly as much revenue from its Asia Pacific & Latin America segment. Nike's stock is down around 8% this year, in what may be a sign that it is starting to stabilize and potentially bottomed out. Its forward P/E of 40 looks enormous, but as the company works on reducing costs and improving its financials, its earnings multiples should improve. These two stocks may continue to struggle in the months ahead as consumers still look to be scaling back on discretionary purchases. High-priced apparel may simply not be much of a priority for consumers untileconomic conditionsimprove. But when they do, the stock that may have the most upside is Nike. It has the stronger brand, and it's more diversified, which can allow it to be more flexible in its growth strategy moving forward. It will, however, likely be a bumpy road ahead for both of these stocks.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Crushing expectations for its fiscal first quarter after market hours on Tuesday, Nike NKEstock spiked over +6% in today’s trading session. Despite weaker digital sales and ongoing challenges in China due to higher tariffs, Nike’s strong Q1 results were driven by a combination of favorable wholesale distribution, growth in its core North American segment, and effective cost management. That said, investors may be wondering if they should chase the post-earnings surge in Nike stock, with NKE moving closer to its 52-week high of $85 a share after hitting a multi-year low of $52 in April. Although Nike’s Q1 earnings of $0.49 per share dropped from $0.70 in the comparative quarter, the retail apparel leader crushed EPS expectations of $0.27 by 81%. This came on Q1 sales of $11.72 billion, which rose from $11.58 billion a year ago and comfortably topped estimates of $11 billion by 6%. Amid the noticeabledecline on its bottom line, Nike has still surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for nine consecutive quarters with a very impressive average earnings surprise of 53.71% in its last four quarterly reports. Acknowledging a dynamic operating environment for both consumers and its global business, Nike stated it remains focused on “win-now” actions but expects revenue for the second quarter of its current fiscal year 2026 to decline by low single digits. This was on par with the current Zacks Consensus of $11.95 billion or a 3% decline (Current Qtr below). Additionally, Nike anticipates Q2 gross margins to be down approximately 300 to 375 basis points, including a net headwind of 175 basis points from new incremental tariffs. Based on Zacks' estimates, Nike’s total sales are expected to dip 1% in FY26 but are projected to rebound and rise 6% in FY27 to $48.59 billion. Optimistically, Nike stock is trading near the optimal level of less than 2X forward sales, with its Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry average at 1X.However, NKE trades at a 41.7X forward earnings multiple, a noticeable premium to thebenchmark S&P 500 and itsindustry average of 21.7X. Showing signs of a turnaround, Nike stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Earnings estimate revisions are likely to rise after Nike's strong Q1 results, but a considerable jump in EPS projections may be needed to move the needle for a buy rating, given the company's moderately stretched P/E valuation.

Revenue was up marginally and net income was down substantially, but both still beat the consensus analyst estimates. In recent timesNike(NYSE: NKE)stock has had plenty of lousy trading sessions, but Wednesday's sure wasn't one of them. After publishing its latest set of quarterly results after market close Tuesday, investors raced into the athleticapparelmaker's shares to push them to a more than 6% gain. That gave the stock an easy victory over theS&P 500index, which posted a 0.3% increase on the day. For its fiscal first quarter of 2026, Nike earned revenue of $11.7 billion. That represented an increase of 1% on a year-over-year basis. Of this, wholesale revenue was a standout, as it leaped 7% higher to come in at $6.8 billion. On the flip side, the company's direct-to-consumer service Nike Direct saw its top line sag by 4% to $4.5 billion.

However, analysts tracking the company were expecting it to do notably worse. Their consensus estimate for revenue was just under $11 billion, and that for per-share net income was well under the actual figure, at $0.22. Referring to Nike's turnaround program, the company quoted CEO Elliott Hill as saying that it made good \"progress through our Win Now actions in our priority areas of North America, wholesale, and running.\" Hilltempered this by stating \"While we're getting wins under our belt, we still have work ahead to get all sports, geographies, and channels on a similar path as we manage a dynamic operating environment.\" In the conference call discussing the quarter, Nike's CFO Matt Friend proffered selected guidance for both the current (second) quarter and the entirety of fiscal 2026. For the latter period Nike is expecting the key wholesale business to get back to \"modest\" growth in the year, although Nike Direct likely will not see higher revenue.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Shares of athletic apparel brand Nike (NYSE:NKE)\n jumped 4.9% in the afternoon session after the company posted third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and profit. The athletic apparel giant reported revenue of $11.72 billion, a modest 1.1% increase year-on-year, but this was enough to comfortably beat analyst estimates of $11 billion. Similarly, its GAAP earnings per share of $0.49 was significantly ahead of the $0.27 consensus forecast. Despite the strong beat against expectations, the results showed some underlying weakness. The company's earnings per share declined from $0.70 in the same quarter last year, and its operating margin contracted to 7.7% from 10.4%, indicating that expenses grew faster than revenue. Nike’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 8 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 29 days ago when the stock dropped 4.1% on the news that the major indices continued to retreat amid profit-taking and renewed concerns about tariffs. Investors reacted to a federal court ruling that most of President Trump's global tariffs were illegal, raising uncertainty over trade policy and the fiscal impact of potential refunds. Rising Treasury yields added to the pressure, with the 10-year climbing above 4.2% and the 30-year nearing 5%, intensifying worries about stretched equity valuations. September's historically weak track record for stocks further dampened sentiment, leaving traders cautious ahead of the jobs report later in the week and the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision. Nike is flat since the beginning of the year, and at $74.01 per share, it is trading 17% below its 52-week high of $89.13 from September 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nike’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $584.41.

However, the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.Revenues of the Swoosh brand owner improved 1% year over year to $11.72 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.02 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues were down 1% year over year.Revenues at NIKE Direct were down 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a currency-neutral basis to $4.5 billion. The decline resulted from a 12% drop in NIKE Brand Digital and a 1% decrease in NIKE-owned stores. Also, wholesale revenues rose 7% year over year on a reported basis and 5% on a currency-neutral basis to $6.8 billion.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have declined 8.8% over the past three months compared with the industry’s 7.8% decline. NIKE Brandrevenues of $11.4 billion increased 2% year over year on a reported basis and were flat on a currency-neutral basis. Results were affected by a decline in China, offset by a currency-neutral growth in North America. We estimated total NIKE Brand revenues to decrease 5.1% year over year to $10.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter due to a 3.5% decline in Direct-to-Consumer and a 6.2% fall in the Wholesale business.Within the NIKE Brand, revenues inNorth Americarose 4% year over year to $5.02 billion. Sales at NIKE Direct were down 3% in the region, including a 10% decrease at NIKE Digital and flat revenues at NIKE Stores. North America continues to build momentum, fueled by consistent brand activity across Sport and the strength of its premier sports marketing portfolio. Wholesale sales rose 11% year over year in North America. Wholesale returned to growth this quarter, aided in part by shipment timing compared with the prior year and increased liquidation volume to value channels.InEMEA, the company’s revenues improved 6% year over year on a reported basis and 1% on a currency-neutral basis to $3.3 billion.

Wholesale revenues for the region declined 9% year over year.InAPLA, revenues increased 2% year over year on a reported basis and 1% on a currency-neutral basis to $1.5 billion. NIKE Direct dipped 6% due to an 8% decline in NIKE Digital and a 5% fall in NIKE stores. Wholesale revenues increased 6% in the region.Revenues at theConversebrand fell 27% on a reported basis and 28% on a currency-neutral basis to $366 million. The decline was due to softness across all territories. NIKE’s gross profit declined 6% year over year to $4.9 billion, while the gross margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) to 42.2%. The gross margin decline was caused by increased wholesale discounts and higher discounts in Nike factory stores. Additionally, elevated product costs, including new tariffs and channel mix headwinds hurt gross margins. We anticipated the gross margin to decline 350 bps to 41.9%.Selling and administrative expenses fell 1% to $4.02 billion. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses declined 60 bps year over year to 34.3%. The decline in SG&A expenses rate was led by reduced brand marketing spend, given the elevated investments made in key sports moments last year. This benefit was partly offset by increased sports marketing expenses in the current period. Our model predicted SG&A expenses of $4.15 billion, indicating a rise of 2.4% year over year.Demand creation expenses declined 3% year over year to $1.2 billion. Operating overhead expenses were flat year over year at $2.8 billion. Our model predicted demand creation expenses of $1.36 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 11.2%.

As of Aug. 31, NIKE repurchased a total of 124.4 million shares for $12.1 billion, as part of its four-year $18-billion share repurchase program approved in June 2022. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, management highlighted that the newly issued tariffs posed a meaningful cost headwind for NIKE, as they layered on top of the mid-teens rate it was already paying on imports. At that time, the company also outlined the actions underway to balance this impact, protecting consumers and partners, advancing its Win Now priorities, and safeguarding the long-term strength of its brands.Since then, reciprocal tariff rates have been raised further in certain countries. With these new rates now in effect, the company estimates a gross incremental annualized cost of roughly $1.5 billion, up from the $1 billion it shared in the prior quarter. As a result, the company now expects a 75-bp increase in net headwind to gross margin for fiscal 2026, which is now expected to be approximately 120 bps.The company also remains focused on executing the mitigation measures it outlined last quarter, while continuing to adapt as the conditions evolve. Even with these near-term pressures, management is confident that NIKE’s scale, brand strength, and seasoned leadership will allow it to navigate this disruption and position the company for sustainable growth.NIKE also outlined its guidance for the second-quarter fiscal 2026. It projects fiscal second-quarter revenues to decline low-single-digits. This includes a one-point gain from foreign exchange. The gross margin is expected to decline 300-375 bps, comprising a 175-bps negative impact from the new incremental tariffs.Management forecasts SG&A dollars to be up by high single digits, driven by higher demand creation investments and a low-single-digit rise in operating overhead. The company predicts other expenses, net of interest income, to be $10-$20 million for the fiscal second quarter. Management expects the tax rate to be in the low 20% range for the second quarter and fiscal 2026, driven by anticipated changes in earnings mix. Backed by the company’s ongoing Win Now actions, it also outlined some insights that will shape its performance for the rest of fiscal 2026. The company sees momentum building up in its wholesale business, driven by an improved Spring order book, aided by growth in sports. As a result, the company expects its wholesale business to return to growth in fiscal 2026.Additionally, the company is actively repositioning NIKE Digital as a full-price business. Organic traffic continues to decline at a double-digit rate, reflecting a prior-year base that was more heavily concentrated on classic footwear franchises, sneaker launches, and a higher mix of off-price sales. As a result, traffic comparisons are expected to remain under pressure. The company does not anticipate NIKE Direct to return to growth in fiscal 2026.In fiscal 2026, the company expects North America to continue leading its global recovery, while Greater China is expected to take longer to rebound given the unique marketplace dynamics. Converse, now under new leadership, is in the middle of resetting its brand and marketplace, which is expected to weigh on both revenues and gross margin through fiscal 2026.The company has made steady progress toward building a healthier marketplace by the first half of the year, though it anticipates modest revenue headwinds across both Wholesale and NIKE Direct, lapping last year’s clearance activity. While foreign exchange has shifted to a tailwind for reported revenues, it will provide minimal gross margin benefit in fiscal 2026 due to its hedged positions. SG&A is expected to increase in low single digits for fiscal 2026, reflecting continued investment in its Win Now actions, particularly in reigniting demand creation and rebuilding both its sports and commercial offense.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Nike (NKE) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.49 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.27 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.7 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of +81.48%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this athletic apparel maker would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.14, delivering a surprise of +16.67%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Nike, which belongs to the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel  industry, posted revenues of $11.72 billion for the quarter ended August 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.49%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.59 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Nike shares have lost about 8.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 13.3%. While Nike has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Nike was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.51 on $11.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.67 on $45.78 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Shoes and Retail Apparel  is currently in the bottom 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Carter's (CRI), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2025. This maker of children's apparel and accessories is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -52.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. Carter's' revenues are expected to be $751.04 million, down 1% from the year-ago quarter.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Athletic apparel brand Nike (NYSE:NKE) announcedbetter-than-expected revenuein Q3 CY2025, with sales up 1.1% year on year to $11.72 billion. Its GAAP profit of $0.49 per share was 84.5% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Nike?Find out by accessing our full research report, it’s free. “This quarter NIKE drove progress through our Win Now actions in our priority areas of North America, Wholesale, and Running,” said Elliott Hill, President & CEO, NIKE, Inc. Originally selling Japanese Onitsuka Tiger sneakers as Blue Ribbon Sports, Nike (NYSE:NKE) is a global titan in athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories. Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, Nike’s 4.5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This fell short of our benchmark for the consumer discretionary sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis. We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Nike’s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 5% annually. We can dig further into the company’s sales dynamics by analyzing its constant currency revenue, which excludes currency movements that are outside their control and not indicative of demand. Over the last two years, its constant currency sales averaged 4.8% year-on-year declines. Because this number aligns with its normal revenue growth, we can see that Nike has properly hedged its foreign currency exposure. This quarter, Nike reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 1.1% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 6.5%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months. Although this projection implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) stock benefiting from the rise of AI.Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories. Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. Nike’s operating margin has shrunk over the last 12 months and averaged 9.7% over the last two years. The company’s profitability was mediocre for a consumer discretionary business and shows it couldn’t pass its higher operating expenses onto its customers. This quarter, Nike generated an operating margin profit margin of 7.7%, down 2.7 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Nike’s unimpressive 3.1% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. This tells us it maintained its per-share profitability as it expanded. In Q3, Nike reported EPS of $0.49, down from $0.70 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Nike’s full-year EPS of $1.95 to shrink by 4.5%. We were impressed by how significantly Nike blew past analysts’ constant currency revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives with regards to the turnaround story under relatively new CEO Elliott Hill. The stock remained flat at $70.18 immediately after reporting. Indeed, Nike had a rock-solid quarterly earnings result, but is this stock a good investment here? What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free.
