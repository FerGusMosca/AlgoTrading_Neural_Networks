Nike’s turnaround plan helped the company sprint ahead of fiscal first-quarter earnings expectations, sending the stock higher in premarket trading Tuesday.  Shares of Nike have shed roughly 30% over the past three years, trading at similar levels as in mid-2018 and erasing most of the gains made during the pandemic-era boom in activewear.  The company’s new management team, led by CEO Elliott Hill, has been working to rectify the business by cleaning out inventories to stock up on new styles and fixing relationships with wholesale partners.
