Major tech stocks helped lift the broader market last week. The major averages rose last week, recording their second positive week out of three. The S&P 500 gained 4.6%, the Dow Jones added 2.5%, the Nasdaq jumped 6.7% and the Russell 2000 advanced 4.1% last week (as of April 25, 2025). Despite this week's rally, April has been mixed overall. The Nasdaq is now slightly positive for the month, but the S&P 500 remains down 1.5% month to date, and the Dow has fallen 4.5%. Big tech stocks were a major catalyst on April 25.AlphabetGOOGL gained 1.7% after the Google parent reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on both revenues and profits.TeslaTSLA surged 9.8%, whileNVIDIANVDA andMeta PlatformsMETA also posted strong advances of 4.3% and 2.7%, respectively. Market volatility has remained elevated as traders react to ongoing developments in global trade policy. Uncertainty surrounds U.S.-China trade talks after China said on April 24 that there were no negotiations underway, following earlier U.S. signals suggesting a possible softening in stance. Further confusion came from President Donald Trump’s comments. In an interview published by Time magazine, Trump said he would consider it a \"total victory\" if high tariffs of 20% to 50% on foreign imports remain for a year from now, as quoted on CNBC. Yet, in comments made Tuesday but published Friday, he hinted at upcoming trade deal announcements \"over the next three to four weeks.\" Speaking separately to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said he would not lift tariffs unless China \"gives us something substantial.\" As of now, Trump wants China to be “open” to more U.S. goods being sold in that country, as quoted on CNBC. Despite the ongoing uncertainty, some market strategists are optimistic. Jay Hatfield, founder and chief investment officer at InfraCap, believes the worst of the tariff-driven market swings may be over, as quoted on the above-mentioned CNBC article. He expects a positive outlook from here. Looking ahead, Hatfield points to upcoming earnings from major hyperscaler firms like Microsoft and Amazon as key drivers for the markets in the coming week.

Trade uncertainty under the new U.S. administration has fueled concerns about rising inflation and a slowing U.S. economy, which has worked in favor of international markets.

Stimulus Abroad:The European Central Bank has been on a rate-cut spree. India and China have also been on a path of policy stimuli (either fiscal or monetary or both). Although the Bank of Japan has been hiking rates, the interest rate backdrop remains low. In contrast, the United States has taken a different approach as the Department of Government Efficiency has prioritized budget cuts, reducing federal expenditures rather than expanding them. The Fed has also been acting less dovish. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning country exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of the first quarter. Poland’s economy did better than expected last year, with a preliminary estimate of GDP growth for the full year at 2.9%, up from the 2.8% consensus forecast. With Q1 2025 is gone now, most forecasters are continuing to suggest that it will move upward to 3.0% or above. This upbeat momentum helped Polish stocks to outperform. Although Spain's economy is projected to experience a slight deceleration (from 0.8% recorded in the previous quarter) in growth in Q1 of 2025, the Bank of Spain’s forecast of GDP growth rate in between 0.6% and 0.7% looks steady. Plus, the ECB remains dovish. Chinese tech stocks have gained momentum in Q1 due to the DeepSeek-style craze. The innovation of cheaper-cost AI by startup DeepSeek have rocked the tech world in Q1. China tech stocks benefited a lot from this announcement. Plus, policy environment has been easier in China (read: DeepSeek Buzz Boosts China Tech ETFs). Greek stocks are gaining popularity among investors. Greece has steadily recovered from its 2009 debt crisis, with borrowing costs now lower than Italy and France, and banks fully privatized. Greek stocks are undervalued compared with Wall Street and offer higher dividend yields (read: Best-Performing ETF Areas of March). Colombia’s stock market surged on election hopes and a stable dollar. The leftist president Gustavo Petro’s poor governance will likely lead to a conservative, pro-business victory in the next election. Cheap stock prices, with the price-to-earnings ratio hitting a 2002 low, also contributed to the rally. Foreign investments have been notable.

      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/11522/3-etfs-every-investor-needs-to-hedge-sampp-500-volatility",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves There are deeper levels to the big machine, the financial market, where investors need to understand the cogs that make it run and when one of them is starting to speed up or slow down in relation to all others. Understanding the world of global macro strategies, where knowing what sudden shifts might implicate for other markets, is the key to anticipating the next market move, placing the odds in favor of those who saw it coming. Today, the S&P 500 is experiencing increased volatility due to President Trump's recent announcements regarding trade tariffs and a recent Federal Reserve (the Fed) outlook that might point to the United States economy slowing down into a potential recession. Of course, the markets took this to heart and delivered a reciprocal level of volatility, creating a need for investors and traders to find other places to hedge away this risk. Understanding global macro starts with a “top-down” view of the global economy, which is where today’s list will come into play under circumstances that will make all the sense for the average investor. Before digging deeper into those trends,one exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, theiShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT), must be considered. Then, international markets will come into play in this broader view. Whenever stocks and other risky asset classes start to become more volatile and, therefore, more risky, institutional and retail investors tend to engage in a “Flight to Safety” behavior, seeking less volatility and an asset class that can protect them from the chaos happening in other areas. Today, this bond ETF offers investors a better way to be in the market outside of this risky asset volatility. Bonds' safety makes them a primary target during times of increased economic uncertainty. As their prices move opposite of their underlying interest yield, President Trump's recent desire for lower interest rates might be a foreshadowing of what’s about to come. This is why this bond ETF hasoutperformed the broader S&P 500 indexby as much as 10% over the past month alone. It gives investors the tools they need to escape the volatility in the stock market through lower volatility setups and a rotation that makes fundamental sense as well. Over the past month, not only did the bond ETF outperform the broader S&P 500, but also two specific ETFs representing overseas markets. Starting with the most controversial one in Asia’s powerhouse, theiShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ: MCHI), has also left the S&P 500 behind by nearly 12%. Then, there is a quiet economy in Latin America making a few splashes lately, and that is Brazil. During this same period, theiShares MSCI Brazil ETF (NYSEARCA: EWZ)followed the same trend as the China ETF, leaving the United States stock market index behind by 9%. Now, investors might be wondering what’s causing the rotation out of the S&P 500 and into these emerging economies, and that is where having that “top-down” view of the global markets makes a global macro strategy so powerful. It all starts with relative valuations in what most have termed the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio between a country’s GDP and its stock market. For the United States, thisratio stands at nearly 200%.For reference, any figure above 100% starts looking a bit dangerous in terms of valuations for businesses in a country. Plus, this 200% would make the S&P 500 the most expensive it’s ever been, according to this measure. It would make sense, then, to see capital flow out of the most “expensive” market as soon as the momentum starts to fade and volatility comes into the scene. The next step is for this capital to end somewhere else, somewhere that’s not seen as expensive or as risky when it comes to this sort of valuation. Looking at China’s ratio, the number falls at only 67%, leaving a significant amount of room for its stock market to rise to the 100% mark or even past it. This is whytechnology stockslikeAlibaba Group (NYSE: BABA)have nearly doubled over the past six months alone, as the flight to cheaper markets is triggered by S&P 500 volatility. For Brazil, the story looks similar at a ratio of 47% today; this is where investors could quickly shift their views from the United States and find themselves invested in Brazil’s stock market. Over the past month, a Brazilian stock likeVale (NYSE: VALE)has outperformed the S&P 500 index by over 13%, showing the ease of flow investors can achieve when global macro views are implemented.

      "content": "It would appear there's a strong \"buy the dip\" case for Ambev (NYSE:ABEV) stock at the moment. Ambev stock has pulled back some 20% in barely a month on almost no news.Source: Daniel Spiess via FlickrReports in Brazilian media this month cited testimony that alleged the company was involved in the country's long-running corruption scandal, often referred to as Operation Car Wash. Ambev has denied any involvement. The company also pointed out that beverage taxes spiked in 2015 -- an increase the bribes ostensibly were meant to prevent.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income Meanwhile, Ambev actually posted a blowout second quarter report last month, with Ambev stock touching a 52-week high on the news. A month later, the stock seems on track to touch a 2019 low. With a reported dividend yield of 5.5%, a more reasonable valuation, and potential growth in Latin America and Canada, the decline seems to present an opportunity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat may be the case. ABEV is cheaper. Growth has been more impressive than it appears. But there are risks here, too -- risks highlighted by the recent decline. Investors should take a look at buying the dip in ABEV stock. They should also understand that the declines can continue. The Case for Ambev StockThere's a lot to like when it comes to Ambev stock. Valuation isn't necessarily cheap: the stock trades at 23.6x trailing twelve-month adjusted EPS. But EV/EBITDA, below 13x, is more attractive.In the context of the industry, those multiples are relatively benign. Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD), who owns over 60% of Ambev, trades at about 12x EV/EBITDA with a much weaker balance sheet. (A-B had to cut its dividend to manage its debt. Ambev has net cash.) Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) trades at a massive premium to ABEV stock. Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ,NYSE:STZ.B) trades at 21x forward earnings despite weaker growth of late.Investors usually are willing to pay a premium for beer or spirits companies because growth can last for decades. For a company like Ambev, whose leading brands in Brazil include Skol, Brahma, and Antarctica, that can be the case.Meanwhile, recent performance looks solid. Earnings took a tumble in 2016, owing to the aforementioned tax hike in Brazil. But normalized EBITDA, as the company terms it, increased nearly 9% year-over-year on an organic basis in the first half despite a big jump in input costs. That follows a 14% increase in 2018 on the same basis.To top it off, ABEV stock provides a solid dividend. Like many overseas companies, Ambev doesn't give a consistent payout. (In fact, it hasn't yet declared a dividend for this year, which is unusual.) But the 2018 payout totaled 12.6 cents - suggesting a 2.9% yield.So there's a nice combination of growth, value, and income -- at a cheaper price to boot. The Risks to ABEV StockThat said, the risks here need to be monitored as well. It's tempting to argue that the 20% decline from post-earnings highs came on no news, bribery allegations aside. But that doesn't mean they came for no reason.Over half of the company's profit comes from Brazil. (About 10% comes from Canada, where the company sells Lablatt beer. The remainder comes from elsewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean.) And investors have quickly soured on Brazilian stocks. The iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (NYSEARCA:EWZ) has declined 14% in the past month.A weaker Brazilian real is an issue. But there is real emerging market risk here as well, with Argentina another sore spot. And so the fact that ABEV stock is cheaper than U.S. beer producers may not mean the stock is cheap. It probably should trade at a discount, given macroeconomic uncertainty and higher volatility.The other issue is the overall health of beer. Certainly, U.S. trends don't look particularly positive. Even SAM stock - which has gained over 80% - has benefited from non-beer growth.At the moment, the overall beer market in Brazil, at least, appears to be growing. But craft brewers are making inroads. The former 'set it and forget it' nature of buying beer stocks might be over -- as witnessed by the huge plunge in BUD stock last year.Both risks have hit ABEV stock hard in recent years. The case for ABEV wasn't terribly different last year at $7, or above $6 back in 2014. Returns for most shareholders, dividends included, have been negative over the past five years. Maybe this time is different; maybe ABEV stock finally is too cheap. Investors have said that before.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

      "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-brazilian-stocks-buy-emerging-202216212.html",
      "content": "Yesterday, JPMorgan released a report that said Brazilian stocks are due for a \"healthy pause\" after a huge rally following the election of it's new pro-business President Jair Bolsonaro. Brazilian stocks have gain 18% since the first round of the elections, and JPMorgan sees it going up as much as 28% more.\n\nWith the global economy still grinding forward, investors looking at emerging market stocks have plenty to like about Brazil. And now, with prices about to \"pause\", it might be a great time to buy Brazilian stocks. Overall, the market is trading for a dirt-cheap P/E of just 12.\n\n  * 5 of the Best Biotech Stocks to Buy Now \n\n\n\nWith that, here are for Brazilian stocks to buy today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSource: Felix Carmona via Flickr (Modified)\n\n### CPFL Energeia S.A. (CPL)\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid any possible volatility is by investing in \"safer\" sectors of the market -- sectors that provide plenty of cash flows and dividends.  One of the best happens to be utility stocks. Well, this theory works the same when it comes to emerging market stocks. For investors looking at Brazilian stocks specifically, that means top utility CPFL Energia S.A. (NYSE:CPL).\n\nCPL is one of Brazil's largest electric companies and has assets that span more than 679 municipalities to more than 9.5 million customers. This includes key states like Brazilian economic powerhouse of Sao Paulo. And this is a good position to be in as it's allowed CPL to pull in some pretty steady and hefty revenues.\n\nDuring its latest reported quarter, CPL managed to see a nice 4% jump in its revenues. Meanwhile, its net income managed to see a big 60% year-over-year increase. That's not too shabby at all and is representative of its continued debt reduction program and stability of Brazilian currency/economy.\n\nLike many U.S. utilities, CPL has undergone some initiatives to boost margins further. The Brazilian utility has added plenty of renewable generation assets as well as begun the initial steps to add smart-meters/grid operations to its core areas. All in all, this should help drive profits higher.\n\nAnd CFL hasn't been scared to share those profits either. The firm has a long history of paying dividends. Today, shares yield 1.7%.\n\nSource: Shutterstock \n\n### Arcos Dorados Holding (ARCO)\n\nMcDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is a global institution and one of the top 10 brands in the world. And while you certainly could buy MCD stock, a better bet could be Brazilian-based emerging market stock Arcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO).\n\nArcos Dorados -- which means Golden Arches -- is the world's largest McDonald's franchisee in terms of system-wide sales and number of restaurants. This includes over 2,100 restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean. Brazil is top on that list with 910 stores. But ARCO owns Big Mac shacks in Mexico, Peru, and even French Guyana.\n\nThis dominance has made ARCO a revenue machine. Last quarter, consolidated revenue jumped by 8.3%, on a constant currency basis, while net income increased by over 68%. One of the big drivers of that was results from Brazil. Thanks to the economy beginning to even out and inflation are tamed, ARCO's managed to see a huge jump to its earnings. Those stores in Brazil managed to realize an adjusted EBITDA increase of 37% year-over-year. And when looking at a constant currency basis, that number spikes to a 73% year-over-year gain.\n\nThese results show that as the Brazilian economy has improved, ARCO's has directly benefited. It should continue to benefit as well.\n\n  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday \n\n\n\nAs for shares itself, ARCO trades at forward P/E of 21. While that's not super cheap, it could still be a bargain as Brazil's growth is only getting restarted.\n\nSource: Shutterstock \n\n### Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB)\n\nFor investors looking to snag-up emerging market stocks, financial institutions and banks are often some of the best places to go shopping. In Brazilian stocks, that's no different. In fact, Brazil is home to one of the largest banks in the southern hemisphere: Itau Unibanco Holding SA (NYSE:ITUB).\n\nITUB was created through the merger of banking giants Banco Itau and Unibanco back in 2008. Since then, the firm has continued to grow through an aggressive, yet smart, acquisition strategy. This included snagging several Lat Am units from Citigroup (NYSE:C) as well as other regional banks in Brazil and Latin America. These buyouts have made ITUB one of the largest banks in the world and it currently controls about 11% of Brazil's retail banking market. The firm also owns the second largest Brazilian card payment company, Rede.\n\nThis makes Itau Unibanco a prime play on the growing consumer base in the nation.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank is very conservatively run and features a solid balance sheet. Recent higher revenues and lower loan provisions underscore Brazil's recent economic strength -- as does ITUB's small monthly dividend and its continued stock dividend bonuses.\n\n### iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ)\n\nFor some investors, buying individual emerging market stocks -- even those from a top market like Brazil -- is a bit daunting. There is still plenty of risks. Perhaps the best way to own the potential of Brazilian stocks is through an ETF that holds a bunch of different firms. The still reigning champion is the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (NYSEARCA:EWZ).\n\nThe $9 billion ETF tracks the MSCI Brazil 25/50 Index. This measure holds a collection of large- and mid-cap emerging market stocks domiciled in the nation. The ETF's 57 holdings read like a who's who of top Brazilian names and include all of the stocks on this list. This provides plenty of diversification benefits and allows investors to easily tap into the nation's long-term potential.\n\nAnd Brazil does have plenty of potential. But just be aware that the ETF is pretty volatile. EWZ's average annual year-to-date, one-, five- and 10-year returns have clocked in at -1.79%, 25.20%, -0.30%, and 4.15% respectively. Since the fund's inception in 2000, the ETF has managed to produce an average annual 6.51% return. As you can see, the ride has been bumpy.\n\n  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio \n\n\n\nBut the ETF is still the best way to play both the short and long-term trade in Brazil. With an expense ratio of 0.59% -- or $59 per $10,000 invested -- it's a cheap option as well.\n\nDisclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.\n\n### More From InvestorPlace\n\n  * 2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid \n  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio \n  * 5 Fintech Stocks to Buy As This Mega Trend Gains Steam \n  * 10 Cold Weather Stocks to Heat Up Your Returns \n\nCompare Brokers \n\nThe post 4 Brazilian Stocks to Buy as the Emerging Market Pauses appeared first on InvestorPlace."

      "content": "To help investors keep up with the markets, we present our ETF Scorecard. The Scorecard takes a step back and looks at how various asset classes across the globe are performing. The weekly performance is from last Friday’s open to this week’s Thursday close. Despite worries about trade wars and an economic slowdown across the board, the U.S. job market is making great strides. In the last month of 2018, the U.S. economy added 312,000 jobs, nearly double the figure expected by analysts. The showing for November itself was revised up by 21,000 to 176,000. At the same time, hourly earnings increased by 0.4% in December on average compared with 0.3% expected by pundits. Such a rise in hourly earnings has not been seen since September. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate jumped from 3.7% to 3.9%, a sign the labor market is expanding and more people are joining the labor force. Amid market turbulence, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attempted to ease market concerns, saying he was aware of the risks stemmed from raising interest rates too quickly and was listening carefully to what the markets had to say. Stocks posted a strong rally this week. On Thursday, Powell spoke again, saying the Fed can be patient on monetary policy given the stable inflation. The Federal Reserve minutes revealed that policymakers have become more dovish, finally acknowledging the risks related to a slowdown in China, trade wars and political turbulence. U.S. non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped dramatically in December, from 60.7 to 57.6, signaling a deteriorating sentiment. U.S. crude oil inventories declined by 1.7 million barrels in the week ended January 4, following two straight weeks of flat gains. Stockpiles have not seen a weekly rise since the end of November when they ended a ten-week streak of gains. U.K. economic output expanded 0.2% in November, beating expectations of 0.1%. The upbeat figure comes as the country still struggles to reach a Brexit solution, with the government and the Parliament at odds. An increasingly likely scenario is to push back the March 29 exit date to avoid chaos."
