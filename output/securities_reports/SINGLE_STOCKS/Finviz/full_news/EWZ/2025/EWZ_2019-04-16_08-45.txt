Brazilian stocks are among the more volatile emerging markets fare.  Brazilian stocks and EWZ rallied earlier this year as markets cheered the reform-minded agenda of President Jair Bolsonaro, who was elected last October.  Since mid-February, EWZ has seen mostly choppy trading and over the past month, the benchmark Brazil ETF is lower by 6.69 percent as investors have questioned Bolsonaro's ability to reform Brazil's pension system, one of the cornerstones of his campaign.
