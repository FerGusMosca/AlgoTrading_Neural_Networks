New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves We recently published10 Stocks With Double-Digit Upsides. Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) is one of the top performers on Thursday. Oklo grew its share prices by 11.10 percent on Thursday, a second straight day, to finish at $128.80 apiece after it was named by the Department of Energy (DOE) as one of the four companies to build advanced nuclear power line projects. In a statement on Tuesday, Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) said it was chosen by the DOE to help build and operate three fuel-fabrication facilities to support the deployment of advanced reactors. The three others were Terrestrial Energy, TRISO-X, and Valar Atomics. In August 2025, Oklo and its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy, an innovator in radioisotope production, were selected for three of DOE’s 11 projects under the Reactor Pilot Program, after executive orders signed in May 2025 aimed at reinvigorating America’s nuclear energy industry. The DOE project also followed Oklo Inc.’s (NYSE:OKLO) newly clinched projects last month, including a $1.68 billion fuel recycling facility as the first phase of an Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee, and its first Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho. While we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.
