      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Even after a recent investor sell-off, the next-generation nuclear energy stock has been a serious gainer. Nuclear is the hot energy technology of the moment, so it's well positioned for success. It's safe to say that a year ago, few investors hadOklo(NYSE: OKLO)on their bingo card as being a major 2025 stock market success. The company, which develops next-generationnuclearreactors, hit its all-time-high stock price near the end of September; at that point, its market value had risen in excess of 1,600% over a mere 12-month period. Oklo is a great example of a company being in the right place at the right time. Now that it's come down a bit from said peak, is its stock now a worthy buy? Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor.See the stocks » Being a supporter of nuclear energy, President Donald Trump has made the once-maligned technology a cornerstone of his administration's energy policy. As is his habit, Trump kicked this into gear with an executive order (EO) issued in May. Titled \"Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security,\" the president laid out his case: \"Advanced computing infrastructure forartificial intelligence (AI)capabilities and other mission capability resources at military and national security installations and national laboratories demands reliable, high-density power sources that cannot be disrupted by external threats or grid failures.\" This push is well suited to Oklo, which, it just so happens, specializes in the kind of advanced reactor technologies on Trump's wish list. Oklo had already started to take off as an investment in the early days of the nuclear-embracing Trump's second term, but it really started to boil after the EO. The nuclear-supporting “big, beautiful bill” provided another boost when it was signed into law in July. Oklo's pop wasn't an isolated case. Other nuclear titles, which, it's safe to say, were obscure to the general public last year, also soared. Small modular reactor (SMR) specialistNuScale Powercranked higher -- not as much as Oklo, but still at a significant clip. Ditto for associated companies like uranium producerCameco. Over that same one-year stretch, those two stocks were up a respective 89% and 282%. For reference, the bellwetherS&P 500index rose \"only\" by 16% during that time. To their credit, neither the federal government nor Oklo is wasting any time to move forward. In mid-August the Department of Energy (DOE) selected the company and its Atomic Alchemy subsidiary to help build three reactor pilot projects. The ambitious DOE would like to \"demonstrate criticality,\" in its words, in three test reactors by July 4, 2026. Barely a week later, Oklo announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with European engineering giantABBto build out a digital monitoring room in its California headquarters. That'll be useful because soon after that announcement, the company broke ground on the first of its Aurora-model powerhouses located at the Idaho National Laboratory. Later that month, Okla secured a strategic partnership with another European company, nuclear reactor developer Blykalla, under which the peers will \"share insights on materials, components, non-nuclear supply chain sourcing, fuel fabrication, and licensing best practices,\" in both the U.S. and Blykalla's native Sweden. Finally, Oklo is strengthening its finances for what has suddenly become a very busy time in its corporate life. Rewinding to June, the company floated a secondary issue of its common stock that was set to bring in gross proceeds topping$540 million. Those above-mentioned developments don't cover every happening for Oklo in the past few months; that can occur when a company or industry is suddenly thrust into the spotlight. However, with Oklo I fear we might be looking at a \"too popular too soon\" situation. Despite the powerful momentum and impressive project wins, we should bear in mind that it's a pre-revenuecompany. Total operating expenses approached $46 million in the first half of this year, filtering down into a bottom-line loss of $34 million and change. It'll take some time for those project monies to come rolling in, which leads to another concern -- its cash runway. These days its cash burn is around$53 million per year, and likely to rise with all that project work (although that recent haul from the share issue gives it some breathing room). Also, its Aurora design hasn't yet been given the green light from federal regulators. With its clear wins and a bright, nuclear-powered future in front of it, Oklo's stock boasts amarket capnear $16.5 billion and a trailingprice/book ratioexceeding 23, even after a recent investor pullback. For comparison, the revenue-generating NuScale's market cap is a shade over $5 billion, and its price/book floats slightly above 7. For me, I'd stay on the sidelines with Oklo. Even though the market's initial frenzy has calmed somewhat, the stock still seems awfully expensive for a business that still has much to prove.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Wall Street is treating next-generation nuclear energy companies such as Oklo as direct bets on artificial intelligence. The reason is simple: large AI data centers consume as much electricity as a mid-sized city, which is a huge reason why U.S. electricity demand is set to grow ~75% by2050. The desperate need for more power to fuel AI expansion helped Sam Altman-backed nuclear energy upstart OkloOKLOstock soar 500% so far in 2025, despite being pre-revenue. Investors have also sent established energy giants such as GE Vernova, Constellation Energy, and Vistra skyrocketing over the past few years. AI hyperscalers are taking an all-of-the-above approach to energy from nuclear and natural gas to solar, which is great for energy storage companies. Oklo looks a bit overheated after climbing 140% since early July.It’s time to buy other stocks that could be the next home-run AI energy investments with huge near-term and long-term upside. Investors looking for the next Oklo might want to consider Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) energy storage companyMicrovast, which trades for under $5 a share, and speculative microreactor stockNano Nuclear Energy. Nano Nuclear Energy Inc.NNEis developing advanced portable micro nuclear reactors. The speculative pre-revenue nuclear company envisions a future where its microreactors provide energy to AI data centers, cargo ships, Moon bases, and beyond. Nano’s bull case is deepened by its strong balance sheet ($210 million in cash and cash equivalents vs. $5 million in total liabilities). NNE said last quarter that it’s experiencing “growing support and interest from long-term oriented institutional investors.” AI hyperscalers are partnering with nuclear energy companies like Oklo and ConstellationCEGto make sure they’re prepared to power their data centers. Big tech companies might even buy a few small nuclear energy companies like Nano because securing power is the most difficult part of the AI supply chain. Nuclear energy, as Nano pointed out in its Q3 earnings report in August, is also backed by “unprecedented bipartisan legislative and policy support in the U.S. for nuclear energy.” NNE is gaining interest from Wall Street. Zacks has five brokerage recommendations for the stock, up from two in the spring (3 out of 5 are “Strong Buys”). Nano Nuclear announced in late September that it was included in the S&P Global Broad Market Index (BMI), “the world's first float-adjusted global benchmark.” NNE was also added to the S&P Total Market Index (TMI), which “encompasses the entire U.S. equity market.” These inclusions expand NNE’s visibility to a large swath of investors. Nano Nuclear stock lagged some of its home-run nuclear energy peers in 2025, yet it is still up 80% YTD and 760% since its early May 2024 IPO. Yet, Nano has not broken out above its early 2025 highs. The stock is heavily short (~28% of the float), setting up the potential for quick and substantial upside if Wall Street takes some of its Oklo winnings and dives into Nano. The chart above shows the NNE has held its ground at its post IPO highs and its 21-day moving average. It is also far from overheated on the RSI front, proving NanoNuclearbreakout potential in Q4 and beyond once it climbs above its January peaks. MicrovastMVSTdesigns, develops, and manufactures lithium-ion battery solutions. The Texas-based company boasts that its cutting-edge cell technology and its vertical integration capabilities extend from core battery chemistry to modules and packs. Microvast is capitalizing on the long-term momentum of solar energy expansion, which necessitates the massive deployment of energy storage solutions. It also benefits from the broader electrification of vehicles, big and small. U.S. utility-scale battery storage grew ~66% last year, with it set to add another 20 GW of battery storage to the grid in 2025, to reach nearly 50 GW, up from essentially zero before 2020. The battery technology company's huge beat-and-raise second quarter report in early August sent its FY25 consensus estimate 46% higher, with its FY26 estimate up 21%. MVST’s positive bottom-line revisions help it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). MVST is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$0.27 a share last year to +$0.19 a share in FY25 and then grow its earnings per share (EPS) by 53% in 2026. It is projected to grow its revenue by 22% in 2025 and 2026 to reach $563.5 million vs. $108 million in 2020. Microvast stock soared 120% YTD and over 2,220% off its November 2024 lows. Yet it still trades roughly 23% below its average Zacks price target and 80% beneath its 2021 highs. MVST stock is on the verge of breaking out to new 2025 highs and overtaking a potentially key level highlighted above that could help it start marching back up to its all-time highs. Investors might also be attracted to MVST’s status as a cheap stock trading for roughly $4.60 a share. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:OKLO) is one of the top performers on Thursday. Oklo grew its share prices by 11.10 percent on Thursday, a second straight day, to finish at $128.80 apiece after it was named by the Department of Energy (DOE) as one of the four companies to build advanced nuclear power line projects. In a statement on Tuesday, Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) said it was chosen by the DOE to help build and operate three fuel-fabrication facilities to support the deployment of advanced reactors. The three others were Terrestrial Energy, TRISO-X, and Valar Atomics. In August 2025, Oklo and its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy, an innovator in radioisotope production, were selected for three of DOE’s 11 projects under the Reactor Pilot Program, after executive orders signed in May 2025 aimed at reinvigorating America’s nuclear energy industry. The DOE project also followed Oklo Inc.’s (NYSE:OKLO) newly clinched projects last month, including a $1.68 billion fuel recycling facility as the first phase of an Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee, and its first Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves President Donald Trump wants to turbocharge the U.S. nuclear energy industry to make the nation self-reliant. The U.S. has kicked off nuclear pilot programs and selected Oklo as one of the participants. Investors should know some things before buying this stock that has risen 500% in 2025. Oklo(NYSE: OKLO)stock is up a staggering 500% so far in 2025. A significant portion of those gains occurred in September, as thenuclear energy stockrallied 51.6% during the month, according to data provided byS&P Global Market Intelligence. Oklo is developing fast-fission, modular nuclear power plants called Aurora that can deliver steady, affordable, and clean energy at scale. That seems to be the right technology at the right time, what with the U.S. government going all-in to drive the domestic nuclear energy industry. And for Oklo, September was a blockbuster month. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor.See the stocks » Since returning to the Oval Office in January, President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders aimed at reviving America's nuclear energy industry. Plans  include restarting and completing existing nuclear plants, building new reactors, and shoring up domestic supplies of key nuclear fuel uranium. In September, Trump signed the Technology Prosperity Deal (TPD) with the U.K. government to fast-track projects in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and nuclear energy. Nuclear is a major focus area, with both nations pledging billions of dollars to speed nuclear site licensing and achieve \"full independence from Russian nuclear fuel\" by the end of 2028. Nuclear energy stocks jumped on the announcement, withOklo stealing the spotlight as investorssee the company as a major beneficiary under the Trump administration. That's because Oklo already has fuel supply agreements with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and was among the handful of companies recently selected by the DOE for its reactor pilot program. In September, Oklo even broke ground  on its first Aurora power plant at Idaho National Laboratory under the pilot program. On Sept. 30, Oklo  was also selected for the DOE's Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Projects, joining three other companies planning to build nuclear fuel fabrication facilities for advanced nuclear reactors. While the stock of a start-uplike Oklocan often surge onmomentum tradingand speculation, that wasn't entirely the case for Oklo in September. Oklo isn't the only one building small, modular, and scalable nuclear reactors to capitalize on the Trump-driven nuclear resurgence, but it has hit quite a few milestones lately, including being picked by the DOE for its nuclear projects and inking collaborations with data center providers. Moreover, Oklo is carving out a unique position by focusing on nuclear fuel recycling. Last month, it announced a $1.68 billion investment to build a fuel recycling facility in Tennessee and said it is looking for opportunities to collaborate with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle the utility's used fuel and later sell nuclear energy to TVA, the largest  public power provider in the U.S. Oklo's dizzying rally this year and a hefty market capitalizationof over $18 billion reflect investors' bold bet on a nuclear energy comeback. But last heard, Oklo doesn't expect to deploy its first plant before late 2027  or early 2028. On top of that, its eventual business plan to sell power under long-term contracts means actual sales won't start flowing once a plant is set up -- it will need buyers for its energy output. Keep that in mind before investing in the stock. TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Oklo wasn’t one of them.

      "title": "3 Best Performing Stocks in 2025 (OKLO, IREN, NBIS)\n\n\n(Zacks)",
      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/183470/3-best-performing-stocks-in-2025-oklo-iren-nbis",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Thus far, 2025 has been another good year for the stock market. The last month in particular has been especially strong, with the S&P 500 now up just over 15% year-to-date. While double-digit gains in the broader indexes are always welcome, what really grabs investor attention are the individual stocks delivering outsized returns. Using the Zacks platform has been a fantastic way to identify some of these market leaders. In fact, every one of the stocks I’ll cover today has been highlighted on Zacks’ website numerous times over the course of this year. To narrow the list, I looked specifically at companies with a market capitalization over $10 billion and then filtered for both year-to-date performance and strong one-month returns. Why add the one-month filter? Because many investors naturally hesitate to buy stocks at all-time highs, preferring to hunt for bargains. But history shows that buying strength, especially names consistently making new highs, can be one of the most powerful strategies. Trailing one-month returns are a strong bullish signal, often pointing to continued momentum ahead. Of course, the highest-flying stocks often come with higher volatility, and these names are no exception. Additionally, each of these stocks have notably lofty valuations. But for investors looking for powerful momentum trading opportunities, these may fit into your portfolio. Three stocks that stood out as 2025’s best performers so far areOklo Inc.(OKLO),IREN Limited(IREN), andNebius Group N.V.(NBIS). Unsurprisingly, each is firmly positioned in the heart of the artificial intelligence boom. Below, I’ll break down their performance and why they’re capturing investor enthusiasm. IREN Limited is a vertically integrated data center company that built its reputation on powering cryptocurrency mining but has more recently pivoted aggressively into the AI infrastructure sector. A key differentiator for the company is that all of its facilities run entirely on renewable energy, giving IREN both a sustainable profile and a major cost advantage through some of the lowest power costs in the industry. One of the most notable recent developments came in the last few weeks when IREN purchased 12,000 GPUs from NVIDIA in a deal worth over $600 million, bringing its GPU fleet to approximately 23,000 units. This is a massive step toward positioning the company as a major AI compute player, and it has been a key driver of the stock’s strong performance in 2025. Unlike the other stocks I am sharing here, IREN Limited is actually earnings positive. That said, its earnings revisions have been volatile, with large swings higher and lower over the past two months, though the stock still currently carries aZacks Rank #3 (Hold). The growth outlook, however, is very strong. Sales are projected to grow 122% this year and another 64% next year. On the bottom line, earnings are expected to soar by nearly 1,600% this year, followed by an additional 34% increase next year. Valuation is lofty, trading at about 66.9x forward earnings, but that’s actually the most reasonable multiple of the group I’ll be highlighting. Looking at the price action, IREN is essentially on the verge of making a new record high, pushing against the $48.80 level. A breakout above that resistance could open the door for another bull run. On the other hand, if shares slip below $43, momentum traders may prefer to wait for a better entry point. Oklo Inc. is an advanced nuclear technology company focused on designing and deploying compact nuclear fission reactors that aim to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable power at scale. Its Aurora reactor is engineered with inherent safety features and is designed to operate for 10 years or more without refueling, which is a major potential advantage if the technology proves successful. This type of power is exactly what will be required as the data center boom progresses. That said, this is easily the most speculative stock in the group. Despite boasting a nearly $20 billion market cap, Oklo currently has no sales or earnings, underscoring just how high-risk and future-oriented the story really is. The stock carries aZacks Rank #3 (Hold), but has had some volatile earnings revisions. On the positive side, Oklo recently broke ground on its first Aurora reactor at Idaho National Laboratory, a milestone that demonstrates progress toward commercialization. Still, any meaningful revenue stream is likely years away. From a technical perspective, the stock experienced a minor correction over the last two weeks but has since broken out of a bull flag formation. As long as shares hold above the $119 level, momentum traders may expect the uptrend to continue. However, with speculative names like Oklo, once momentum breaks, downside can be swift, so risk management must be tight. Nebius is an AI infrastructure company that operates a “NeoCloud,” a specialized cloud computing platform designed for high-performance GPU and AI workloads. The company’s services leverage NVIDIA hardware and software to provide scalable AI compute infrastructure, putting it right at the center of the most powerful tech trend of the decade. Nebius is still a net negative earnings company, making it a more speculative story. But the scale of its recent contract win underscores why investors are so excited. Nebius just announced a $17.5 billion deal with Microsoft, set to begin later this year, which validates its platform and highlights how quickly massive AI infrastructure deals can materialize. Growth forecasts are eye-popping. Sales are expected to grow 220% next year, though profitability remains out of reach in the near term. The company’s earnings revisions trend has been volatile, but the stock currently carries aZacks Rank #3 (Hold). Price action has been nothing short of spectacular. Shares are making new record highs, breaking out of multiple bull flag patterns, and momentum remains firmly to the upside. For pattern traders, waiting for consolidation may provide a cleaner entry point. But for those comfortable buying strength, Nebius represents one of the purest momentum trades in the market right now. Position sizing and risk management are critical, as these high-octane names can move both ways quickly. That being said, Nebius is arguably the strongest stock in the market today, and it’s likely to remain a magnet for investor attention in the weeks ahead. There’s no question these are high-risk, high-reward names. Each of these stocks carries lofty valuations, volatile earnings trends, and in some cases, no revenue at all. But they also represent some of the most compelling themes in the market today—artificial intelligence, data center infrastructure, and next-generation power solutions. For investors who are comfortable with volatility and know how to manage risk, the near-term momentum in these names could continue to drive outsized gains. With the market heading into year-end and investors chasing performance, it’s not hard to imagine these leaders attracting even more attention. That said, these stocks are best suited for traders and aggressive growth investors. They’re not steady compounders, and they’re not cheap. But in markets like this, the strongest stocks often keep getting stronger. If momentum remains intact, NBIS, IREN, and OKLO may continue to be some of the best performing stocks in 2025.

Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor.See the stocks » The company, along with three others, will join the DOE's Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Project, which Oklo says is similar to the Reactor Pilot Program, another DOE initiative it has already been selected for. The new program will see the company \"build and operate three fuel-fabrication facilities to support the deployment of advanced reactors.\" Oklo's inclusion in the new program is yet another sign that its technology is market-leading. The opportunity for Oklo is huge. Nuclear energy is having a renaissance of sorts, and with its compact fast reactor design, the company could be particularly well positioned to benefit from streamlined licensing. However, it has yet to generate meaningful revenue and trades on promise rather than performance; its valuation makes me pause. The technology for modular nuclear reactors still needs to be perfected, and there's no guarantee that successive administrations will be as pro-nuclear as the current one. But if you have a higher risk tolerance,Oklo is a solid pick.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Oklo (NYSE: OKLO)insiders sold in Q2 and Q3, netting more than $50 million in the process. However, as bad as it may seem for the stock price outlook, investors shouldn’t worry about theinsider activity. The critical takeaway from the activity is that insiders sold less than 1% of the company’s stock, still control nearly 20% of the business, including large shareholders, and the sales should have been anticipated. Oklo’s stock hasrisen as much as 450%for the year, with much of the movement occurring in Q2 and Q3, presenting a wicked hot opportunity to take money off the table. Insiders who sold included director and early investor M.S. Klein, who sold in four tranches, and the CEO and CFO, who sold once and twice, respectively. Market support for Okloswelled in Q2 and is evident in data beyond the stock price movement. The data tracked by MarketBeat reveals that both analyst coverage and institutional exposure increased significantly, driving the rapid influx of capital that led to a rise in share prices. Theanalyst data coveragehas nearly doubled since early 2025 and grown by about 400% compared to last year. At the same time, the sentiment is firm, and the price target is rising sharply. The consensus lags behind the market by 25% as of early October, but has increased by 700% over the last year and 20% in the preceding 30 days, with a trend pointing to a high-end value of $150, sufficient for a new all-time high. Institutional trends are also robust, providing support for the market. MarketBeat data reveals that this groupowns more than 85% of the stockand has been buying at a pace of approximately $3 to $1 all year. Buyers include large fund managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard, as well as a broad range of private and public wealth managers. The takeaway is that this market is in an accumulation phase despite the insider selling, and it will likely persist due to the rapidly improving outlook and potential for explosive growth. Not only is Oklo the small-modular-reactor stock with the most visible pipeline, but it is also the one with the fastest-growing pipeline. The latest news includes itsselection by the DOEfor a pilot nuclear fuel project. Although not unexpected, the program allows Oklo to develop its high-assay low-enrichment (HALEU) fuel capacity, clearing hurdles to its fuel supply line and opening doors to industrial demand. HALEU fuel isn’t required for advanced fast reactors, but it helps ensure optimal and efficient operations with the lowest cost and refueling requirements. Oklo stock is not without risks, and the highshort interesthighlights them. The short sellers have been selling into the rally, driving their interest to a record high of 16% as of mid-September. Causes for concern include the stock’s rapid share price rise, its high valuation, and execution risks. Oklo’s technologies are proven; the risk is that they’ve never been incorporated into a single, functioning reactor before. However, the company has broken ground on its first project and is expected to complete it by late 2027. The revenue outlook is robust. The company is expected to begin generating revenue by late 2027 and grow at a hyper pace over the next five to ten years. The forecasts exceed $1 billion in the 2029/2030 timeframe, reaching $10 billion by 2035 and continuing to rise from there. Profits aren’t expected until 2029, but they are also likely to be robust and grow at a hyper pace once profitability is reached.

The bad news is that there doesn't seem to be any funding attached to the contracts. Start-upnuclear reactor builderOklo(NYSE: OKLO)jumped 2.2% through 11:55 a.m. ET Wednesday after the Department of Energy (DOE) named the company to yet another set of nuclear pilot projects. Oklo, which specializes in compact nuclear reactors, has already been awarded three contracts for test versions under theDOE's Reactor Pilot Program.Now the agency has chosen the company to also work on building a supply chain producing fuel for nuclear reactors. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » Oklo is the only publicly tradednuclear energy companyalongside three private companies: Terrestrial Energy, Triso-X, and Valar Atomics. The DOE says Oklo will build advanced nuclear fuel lines to reduce reliance on foreign sources of enriched uranium. Specifically, it will build and operate three fuel fabrication plants to support its Aurora and Pluto compact nuclear reactors, and \"possibly other fast reactors.\" But the DOE clearly says each of the four companies listed above will be responsible for the costs of construction, operation, and decommissioning of their fuel fabrication plants and must \"manage the sourcing of nuclear material feedstock.\" That appears to mean Oklo gets nogovernment subsidiesunder this particular contract. This means that more than ever, investors need to keep an eye on Oklo's cash burn rate. While winning DOE pilot-project contracts is great, the lack of government subsidies makes cash management paramount for the company. The good news here is that, with more than $530 million in the bank and a current cash burn rate of $53 million, Oklo is in no immediate danger of running out of money. The bad news is that analysts see cash burn accelerating as its projects get underway, to roughly $1.5 billion over the next five years.

      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/180632/octobers-top-5-stocks-poised-for-big-breakouts",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves September was not just a hot month on the calendar; it was also a breakout period for the stock market. A wave of renewed optimism and stronger outlooks helped lift the S&P 500 tofresh all-time highs, with a handful of companies driving much of the momentum. As investors turn their attention toward the final stretch of the year, the key question is which stocks can keep the rally alive and deliver further gains in the months ahead. This review highlights five stocks with improving fundamentals, stronger analyst sentiment, and clear potential to build on recent momentum. From energy innovation to enterprise AI and cybersecurity, these names demonstrate why September’s surge may only be the beginning. Oklo (NYSE: OKLO)reached a peak in late September and subsequently pulled back into a buying opportunity. The pullback is due to cooling sentiment, but there is a caveat. The cooldown was caused by caution following the triple-digit summer run-up, not by a deterioration in the outlook. If anything, the outlook continues to improve, withthe deal pipeline growingand the path to commercial viability becoming clearer. Regarding the analysts, no analysts reduced their price target. A few have reduced their ratings to Hold or Neutral equivalents from higher levels. The trend, however, reveals thatcoverage has improved considerablyover the last six months. The sentiment is firm, and the price target is rising, up 26% in the preceding 30-day period and more than 700% since last year. Amprius Technologies (NYSE: AMPX)is in a similar position to Oklo. However, this company is not pre-revenue; revenue isramping at a hyper paceand is expected to bestrong in the upcoming report. This market broke to a long-term high in September, entering a consolidation at the month’s end. The consolidation shows support above the critical level, coinciding with the now-broken resistance point, and is likely to result in new highs before the end of the year. The catalyst for this move will be the upcoming earnings report, in which revenue is forecasted to grow by 10% sequentially and 110% year-over-year, driven by the outperformance of consensus estimates. Workday’s (NASDAQ: WDAY)stock price has struggled with traction over the past few years due to an uncertain growth outlook. The company was growing and positioned to continue, but the gains were mostly priced in; outperformance was not part of the equation. The story in October is that thebusiness is regaining momentumdue toAI technology and automation. Workday is a leading HR automation platform that is growing its client base, deepening its penetration of existing clients, and expanding an ecosystem in which its services integrate with other leading enterprise-quality SaaS platforms. September news includes plans to accelerate the expansion of its ecosystem, new partnerships with hyperscalers, and apositive impact on analysts' sentiment.Sentiment trends include increased coverage, a strengthened Moderate Buy rating, and price target increases, which are driving the stock toward the $300 level. Salesforce’s (NYSE: CRM)market has struggled because the company, although growing, has failed to impress the analysts. The takeaway is that this blue-chip, megacap, industry-leading AI powerhouse is growing at a double-digit pace, producing robust margins, and maintaining a healthy cash flow. Salesforce’s cash flow is aimed at several objectives, includinggrowth and capital return. The capital return is an attractive opportunity because it includes a dividend and share repurchases that are reliable, expected to grow in size, and reduce the share count,providing leverage to investors. CRM stock may never experience a wicked hot rally again, but it is deeply undervalued in early October and likely to rise by 50% or more over the next four to six quarters. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD)is another company that hasreinvigorated its growth outlook, driving its stock up approximately 20% in September. The move was driven by outperformance, improved guidance, new partnerships with Salesforce, andstrengthening sentiment. The analyst trends reveal strong and improving coverage, with 47 ratings tracked by MarketBeat firming sentiment and a bullish bias, resulting in a Moderate Buy rating. The forecast indicates that the stock is expected to rise by as much as 25% over the next few quarters.

      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/180541/should-you-buy-oklo-stock-even-though-its-more-than-100",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Nuclear startup Oklo's shares have skyrocketed to more than $100 during the past month. The company just held a groundbreaking ceremony for its first small modular reactor. If Oklo's technology works as planned, there's plenty of room for growth, even at its current valuation. Shares of nuclear power startupOklo(NYSE: OKLO)have skyrocketed in September, with shares gaining about 50% in price during the past month alone. At more than $100 a share, the stock is now up more than 12-fold from its year-ago price. Have investors missed the boat, or is there still time to cash in on this red-hot growth stock? Oklo is one of a number ofnuclear energy startupsexploring small modular reactor (SMR) technology. Unlike existing nuclear plants, which have footprints of about one square mile, SMRs can be housed in a facility about the size of a large warehouse. In fact, on Sept. 22, Oklo held a huge groundbreaking ceremony near Idaho Falls, Idaho, for just such a facility. This will be the first Aurora power plant, an SMR-powered electrical generation plant. Once the power plant is constructed, it will house a sodium-cooled fast reactor SMR, which is theoretically more efficient and can be powered by spent fuel from existing reactors in addition to the standard enriched uranium fuel. This will be Oklo's first attempt at creating a working prototype of its SMR, so it's in a similar situation as abiotech startupwith a drug that's about to startclinical trials: if the drug works with no unforeseen problems, the company is likely to get regulatory approval to start selling its drug and its stock price will jump. If the drug doesn't work as well as expected, or causes unforeseen serious side effects, the drug may not be approved and the stock will crash. In other words, Oklo's not forrisk-averse investors. One big difference, though, is that while drug trials usually last five years or more, Oklo's nuclear test power project is on a much faster timeline. Oklo is participating in the Reactor Pilot Program run by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE). The program's goal is to demonstrate criticality in three test reactors by July 2026: less than a year from now. A lot of influential people want to see Oklo's project succeed. Speakers at the groundbreaking ceremony included Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Lee Zeldin, the governors of both Idaho and Utah, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) commissioner Bradley Crowell, and members of the U.S. Senate. Support from these key players -- many representing agencies that will need to approve the project or some portion thereof -- doesn't guarantee that the technology will work as planned, but it certainly can't hurt. At this stage, it's difficult to value Oklo as a business. The company has no current sales or earnings to speak of, and won't have any until it begins to commercialize its SMRs and sell the power they generate. But what would Oklo be worth at that point? Oklo's SMRs are expected to generate as much as 75 megawatts (MW) of electricity each -- compared to about 1,000 MW for a standard nuclear power plant -- but their actual cost and generation capacity under real-world conditions is unknown. However, Oklo says it has a current \"customer pipeline\" representing 14 gigawatts (GW) of total generation capacity (although it's unclear how firm these customer commitments are). But for the sake of argument, let's use that number. What is 14 GW of generation capacity actually worth? It's tough to find an apples-to-apples comparison, since manyenergy companiesprovide electricity transmission and distribution ornatural gasservices alongside their electricity generation, butPPL Corporation(NYSE: PPL)andWEC Energy Group(NYSE: WEC)each have generation capacity of between 7.5 and 8.5 GW (in addition to providing other services) and market caps of $27 billion and $37 billion, respectively. This suggests that Oklo would be worth much more than its current $17 billionmarket capif its technology performs as expected. But if Oklo's SMRs work as planned, an excited market is likely to bid its shares up even further, meaning that there's still plenty of potential upside for Oklo's stock, even at its current valuation. Unfortunately for new investors, though, there's not as much upside as there was a month ago. But if you can stomach the risk, it doesn't look too late to buy in.

Paced by the so-called Magnificent Seven, the broad market index has soared as AI-driven growth has fueled stocks likeNvidia,Meta, andMicrosoft. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » There is some evidence that a bubble could be forming in the S&P 500. After all, the index is unusually expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and theCAPE ratio,which adjusts for inflation, is even more expensive. The so-called Buffett indicator, a ratio of the S&P 500's market cap to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)is also at an all-time high. However, theAI stocksleading this charge aren't as expensive as you might think. The chart below shows five of the leading AI stocks. Although none of those stocks are cheap, they are mostly in line with the S&P 500, and all are delivering double-digit percentage growth. Nvidia, which is the most expensive of the group, is also the fastest growing, and its revenue is forecast to grow by 56% in its next quarterly report. Rather than in large-cap stocks, thebubbleforming in the stock market appears to be happening in zero-revenue, emerging technology stocks, and it's reminiscent of earlier stock market bubbles. For example, in the dot-com era, droves of small internet companies went public with little or no revenue and unproven business models. That helped hasten the bust in 2000. During the pandemic era, we saw a similar phenomenon with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), nearly all of which crashed or went bankrupt, even though they generally had successful debuts. Other emerging technology stocks with little revenue, like electric vehicles, mostly went bankrupt or crashed in that era. Even the higher-profile newcomers likeRivianandLucidlost more than 90% of their value. This time around, there are a number of emerging sectors that are demonstrating similar trends. For example, modular nuclear reactor companyOklo(NYSE: OKLO)has jumped 1,200% during the past year even though the company has no revenue and doesn't expect to generate revenue until at least late 2027. It is currently attempting to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and has not sold a purchase agreement yet. Oklo currently has a market cap of almost $17 billion. Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are another sector that has gotten frothy despite minimal revenue.Archer Aviation(NYSE: ACHR), which also has no revenue, currently trades at a market cap of $6 billion. Finally, quantum computing stocks have soared this year, even though that sector is still producing little or no revenue. One stock,Quantum Computing(NASDAQ: QUBT), is up nearly 3,000% during the past year and its market cap has reached $3.7 billion, though it expects to generate less than $1 million in revenue this year. Investor enthusiasm for AI stocks seems to have carried over to emerging technology sectors that are unproven, much as it did in the dot-com era and during the pandemic. Although companies like Oklo and Archer Aviation have potential, their current valuations don't seem to factor in the downside risk in the stock. It's likely to take years to build significant revenue, and even if they get there, that's not a guarantee of success. In the current stock market, any of these stocks could crash if investor sentiment starts to shift. For the businesses to grow into their valuations without a major pullback seems unlikely.

Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » Bank of America removed its buy rating from Oklo stock today, as The Fly reports today,downgradingthe nuclear stock to neutral. On the plus side, BofA did give Oklo a $117 price target -- and the stock costs $110 right now! That sounds a bit weird to me. It gets weirder still once you hear what BofA just said about Oklo's valuation. According to the analyst, there's \"little room for error\" in Oklo's current share price -- which, again, is now$7 cheaperthan what BofA says is a good price. No wonder that BofA says the \"near-term risk/reward [on Oklo stock] skews negative.\" Following BofA's advice on Oklo, it seems, will just about guarantee an investor to lose money. But it gets worse. According to BofA, at its current valuation, Oklo stock seems to assume that the company will deploy new nuclear reactors at a pace that BofA says is \"unrealistic at this stage\" of small modular reactor adoption. Granted,long term, BofA is still bullish on nuclear energy. But most analysts think it will be another five years before Oklo starts earning any profit. When profits lie so far in the future, $110 a share is probably too much to pay, and are not even guaranteed to happen. Long story short, BofA thinks Oklo stock is a \"hold\" today -- but Oklo stockstill looks like a sell to me.

Monday, President Donald Trump will meet with congressional leaders in a last-minute effort to avoid a government shutdown. Should President Trump and the Democrats fail to reach an agreement, the government will shutdown Tuesday at midnight. A government shutdown transpires when the United States Congress is unable to gather the minimum number of votes needed to pass an appropriation (payments from the US Treasury for a specific purpose) or a temporary continuing resolution to fund the federal government’s spending for the next fiscal year. When a government shutdown occurs, non-essential government employees are put on unpaid leave, essential government workers (like air traffic controllers) must work without pay (until a resolution is passed, where they receive back pay), and government services such as National Parks close. Government shutdowns are relatively rare. Over the past twenty years, there have been four major government shutdowns. History suggests that extended shutdowns are extremely rare. For instance, half of the government shutdowns over the past twenty years were resolved within three days. In 2018, the government shutdown for 35 days over a US-Mexico border dispute during the first Trump presidency. The government also shutdown for 16 days in 2013 over a congressional fight over Affordable Care Act (ACA) spending. Based on recent rhetoric from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Donald Trump, a government shutdown appears likely. In a recent NBC News interview, Schumer said,“If the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won’t get anything done.”Meanwhile, President Trump said that a shutdown is likely because“Democrats are crazed”and added“If it has to shut down, it’ll have to shutdown.” Bettors on betting website Polymarket seem to agree, with 59% predicting a government shutdown by October 1st(though the odds have dropped from a peak of 77% of bettors predicting a shutdown last week) Although government shutdowns can have a dramatic impact on government workers and produce alarming headlines, they generally have little impact on US equities. In fact,Bank of Americadata indicates that the S&P 500 Index has gained ~1% on average during recent government shutdowns. Beyond the evidential price data that tells investors not to fear shutdowns, the current market conditions should be taken into account by investors. The stock market has been very bullish recently. How Strong? Stocks just completely ignored late-September seasonality trends, which are historically negative, driven by continued strength in AI stocks likeCoreWeaveandOracle, nuclear energy stocks likeOkloand quantum computing stocks likeRigetti ComputingandIonQ.Now with September nearly in the rearview mirror, stocks should benefit as they enter a seasonally strong period. Beyond bullish seasonality tailwind, stocks should benefit from interest rate cuts. Additionally, market breadth (participation) remains robust, with the number of S&P 500 stocks above the 20-, 50-, and 200-day moving averages increasing. Historically, deep market pullbacks with these conditions are extremely rare. While the political rhetoric makes a government shutdown seem probable, investors need not panic. Historically, these shutdowns have been short-lived and have generally had a minimal, if not positive, impact on stocks. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of+48.4%, +50.2%and+56.7%per year.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) factored into Jim Cramer’s discussion of speculative stocks. He’s been wary of the firm this year, but recently when in a Mad Money episode which aired on September 9th, Cramer commented: “I don’t think it’s done going higher.” However, in this show, he discussed some key factors surrounding Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) “[On stock down due to reports of insider selling] Yeah they’re all part of the same. And I know that David remembers, it was when the insiders started to bail when they realized that these prices were too elevated, David that was in March and April of 2000. Now I know we have to try to always figure out what period we’re in. But I can tell you we saw in 2014, we saw something very similar. When the insiders are bailing like Carl just said, you don’t wanna be a buyer. The insiders have basically said, hey listen, we’re in for the run. But that seems to be ending. That’s prudent. Obviously if you were the investment advisor to Oklo, and you just had a stock up hundred, I don’t think you’d say listen double down.  I think we have some prudent selling here. Driven in part by the fact that interest rates have now we can say officially, that I think we can say that the rate cut failed. Well the rates are going higher not lower. “Oklo is a classic example. It was at 33, it got a couple of headlines about how Tennessee’s going well and now it’s at 133. I don’t like that. “Oklo’s got this very serious, recycling of spent fuel, great idea. But I think the idea that you can determine when a plant’s gonna start, it smacks of when Southern was saying, don’t worry about it, don’t worry about it, don’t worry about it, and then it turned out to be the biggest blackhole that Southern’s ever had. Worse than Commonwealth & Southern which was run by Wendell Willkie!” While we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

In addition to the company announcing a new partnership, an analyst's new bullish take on the stock is contributing to investors' enthusiasm today. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » Forging a new collaboration that expands its presence in Europe, Oklo announced a strategic partnership today with Blykalla AB, a Swedish developer of SMRs. In addition to collaborating on SMR technology, the partnership will address supply chain coordination and insights into regulatory processes. The agreement will also see Oklo provide about $5 million to Blykalla's next investment round. Investors are also bidding Oklo stock higher today in response to news thatBarclayshas initiated coverage of Oklo stock, assigning anoverweight ratingand $146price target. According to The Fly, Barclays recognizes Oklo as a \"levered way\" to gain exposure to the SMR industry, since the company develops, owns, and operates its SMRs, or Aurora powerhouses, which can contribute to strong cash flows. Barclays also predicates its outlook on Oklo stock on the company's 14-gigawatt backlog of nonbinding agreements.Based on shares of Oklo closing at $110.53, the $146 price target from Barclays implies upside of over 32%. The Barclays price target onOklo stockis worth noting, but analysts often have shorter investing horizons than thelong-term holding periods The Motley Fool favors. While the stock may rise higher, there are still ample risks, since it still doesn't have a design approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, so investors should proceed with caution.

Oklo develops small microreactors that can be linked together in smaller deployments than traditional nuclear reactors. Nextracker's solar tracking systems shift and tilt solar panels so that they automatically follow the sun's movement. Over the past 12 months, Oklo's stock has skyrocketed by more than 1,300% while Nextracker's stock nearly doubled. But which of these soaring energy stocks is a better buy from here? Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Each of Oklo's Aurora microreactors only generates 1.5 megawatts (MW) of electricity, but they can be chained together in clusters to generate 15 MW to 100 MW of power. That flexibility makes them better suited for remote and off-grid deployments than traditionalnuclear reactors, which produce about 1,000 MW of power and aren't inherently modular. The Aurora reactor also uses metallic uranium fuel pellets, which are denser, more resistant to high temperatures, and cheaper to fabricate than the uranium dioxide fuel pellets used in traditional nuclear reactors. Metallic uranium fuel pellets can also be reprocessed and recycled in a closed loop, so the reactors don't need to be refueled for about a decade. Traditional nuclear reactors need to be refueled every two years. Oklo initially attracted a lot of attention because Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, was serving as its chairman. The Department of Energy also approved its permit to deploy its first microreactors in Idaho in 2019, and the company recently broke ground on its first plant. However, it doesn't expect to complete those first deployments until late 2027 or early 2028. So for now, it isn't generating any revenue, and is racking up significant losses. Oklo's bulls expect the company's sales to soar after it deploys its first microreactors. The rapid growth of thecloud infrastructureand artificial intelligence (AI) markets should also drive more companies toward newer nuclear energy solutions -- like microreactors -- to support their power-hungry data centers. According to an analysis by Zion Market Research, as those tailwinds continue to drive demand for electricity higher, the global microreactor market could expand at a compound annual rate of 19.1% from 2025 to 2034. Mostsolar panelsare installed on fixed-tilt mounting systems set at an angle that will allow them to capture the most sunlight. Nextracker's solar tracking systems swivel, and are programmed to automatically follow the sun. That boosts the energy output of solar panels mounted on them by 15% to 25% compared to fixed panels. In 2024, Nextracker ranked first in the global solar tracking systems space with a 26% market share, according to Wood Mackenzie. Markets and Markets expects the global solar tracker market to continue expanding at a compound annual rate of 17.3% from 2024 to 2029 as more utility companies and enterprise customers adopt the technology to maximize the energy produced by their solar panels. To widen its moat against its smaller competitors, Nextracker is investing in new AI and robotics technologies to strengthen its automated tracking abilities. It also acquired several adjacent players in its industry (with specializations in solar panel cleaning, solar frames, and 3D maps) over the past year, expanding its ecosystem. From its fiscal 2022 to its fiscal 2025 (which ended in March), its revenue grew at a compound annual rate of 27%, from $1.46 billion to $2.96 billion. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) grew at a compound annual rate of 103% from $92.3 million to $776.5 million. And its net income soared tenfold from $50.9 million to $509.2 million. All of that robust growth was fueled by a renewed interest in solar power as cheaper solar modules and more generous government incentives reduced the costs of installing big solar systems. However, from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nextracker's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow at compound annual rates of 12% and 8%, respectively. Oklo has a lot of growth potential, but it already has amarket capof $19.36 billion -- or 1,383 times the $14 millionin salesit's expected to generate in 2027 as it deploys its first microreactors. Nextracker, which is valued at $10.77 billion, trades at just 3 times this year's sales. So for now, it makes more sense to invest in Nextracker, which has already proven that it can commercialize its products and scale up its business. Oklo might have a bright future, but I wouldn't touch its stock until it brings its first Aurora microreactor online.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Rising infrastructure buildouts of AI data centers is causing increasing demand for alternative power sources. Nuclear energy is swiftly emerging as a viable long-term solution to today's AI-driven power constraints. Oklo has become a popular nuclear energy stock given its potential to ride secular AI tailwinds. Over the past three years, artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved from a trendy buzzword into a tangible driver of economic growth. While next-generation chips and breakthrough software programs often dominate the headlines, savvy investors are looking beyond the obvious use cases. A less flashy but equally critical application is emerging in the background: energy. Let's explore the link betweengenerative AIdevelopment and its massive power consumption. From there, I'll consider whetherOklo(NYSE: OKLO)-- a newcomer to the nuclear power revolution -- is poised to disrupt the $10 trillion buildout of AI infrastructure. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Large language models (LLMs) and AI workloads are powered by clusters of chips inside massive data centers, which consume electricity on a scale on par with entire nations. The reason for this is thattrainingadvanced models requires millions of GPUs to run continuously -- placing enormous strain on energy systems. In addition,inference-- the process of actually deploying AI services at scale -- adds an ongoing layer of demand. With that in mind, it's not surprising that traditional energy sources are struggling to keep pace with the exponential growth of AI development. Moreover, these power sources are also beginning to fall behindsustainable energybenchmarks, too. While renewable energy will remain as part of the long-term solution, their variability can make them unreliable as a sole power source for AI's constant workloads. This is wherenuclear energyenters the conversation. Nuclear offers clean, reliable baseload electricity -- exactly the type of profile that hyperscalers likeMicrosoft,Alphabet,Oracle,Meta Platforms, andAmazonneed to support their rapid expansion of AI data centers. Traditional nuclear power plants can take decades to plan with regulators while also requiring billions in upfront capital outlays before generating even a single megawatt of electricity. Oklo has ambitions to change this approach. The company is designing compact \"microreactors\" that can theoretically be built and deployed far more quickly and at a fraction of the cost compared to today's mainstream solutions. Smaller modular systems are intended to serve markets where conventional nuclear projects would be unrealistic -- such as powering large-scale AI data centers. To support its vision, Oklo has secured early partnerships with the Department of Energy (DOE) -- a move that lends some degree of credibility in an industry where new entrants often face scrutiny or regulatory pushback. Oklo's pitch to investors is straightforward. If the company can demonstrate that small-scale nuclear is both practical and commercially viable, the company could position itself to play a role in the broader clean energy transition while simultaneously capturingsecular AI-driven demand tailwinds. At first glance, this all sounds compelling. However, reality sets in when you consider that shares of Oklo have skyrocketed by 1,330% over just the past year. But if the technology is truly disruptive, could these gains be justified? The answer is nuanced. Oklo has yet to actually deploy or sell any of its reactors. With a market capitalization of $17.5 billion, Oklo stock trades at an implied forwardprice-to-sales(P/S) ratio of1,250based on a 2027 projected revenue target of $14 million. This valuation is, by any standard, absurd. Oklo is priced well beyond perfection -- shares are trading in a stratosphere that defies any sound financial logic and echoes paststock market bubbles. For prudent investors, the best move is to pass on Oklo stock for now and simply monitor the company's progress. While the nuclear energy's potential role in the AI era is real and increasingly promising, there are better-positioned opportunities that capture this long-term trend.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Nuclear energy is enjoying a global revival, with policymakers pushing for tripled capacity by 2050 and investors eyeing clean baseload power as essential for both electrification and artificial intelligence. Against this backdrop,Oklo Inc.(OKLO) andThe Southern Company(SO) stand out. Oklo represents a bold, disruptive bet on small modular reactors, while Southern Company offers decades of operating experience and a proven record of delivering shareholder returns. Both companies are deeply tied to nuclear, but their stories could not be more different. One is a pre-revenue innovator chasing transformative growth. The other is a regulated utility, delivering steady earnings and dividends through one of the largest nuclear fleets in the United States. Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to figure out which one offers better prospects. OKLO has captured attention with its Aurora microreactors, designed to deliver compact, reliable nuclear power for data centers, military bases, and industrial sites. The company pitches itself not as an equipment seller, but as an operator, securing long-term power purchase agreements to build recurring revenues. On paper, a 14 GW pipeline translating into $5 billion in annual revenues by 2028 makes the growth story sound compelling. Partnerships with Liberty Energy, Vertiv, and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power bolster its credibility. But ambition comes with risk. Oklo is still pre-revenue, and its first unit is not expected to generate power until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest. The timeline is fraught with hurdles—regulatory approvals, construction challenges, and financing needs. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission already rejected its first application in 2022, and even if a new one is filed in late 2025, reviews could take years. Every delay stretches the wait for revenues further and raises doubts over execution. OKLO has also become closely linked to the AI energy story, with its small modular reactors pitched as an ideal solution for data centers’ immense electricity demand. While this connection keeps investor interest high, it adds pressure to deliver on promises. At the same time, cash burn remains steep at $65-$80 million annually, making further equity raises inevitable. The $440 million stock issuance in June 2025 diluted shareholders, and more capital raises are likely, given the capital intensity of nuclear projects. For investors, Oklo is a highly speculative bet — potentially transformational, but burdened with long timelines and funding risk. Southern Company, by contrast, represents the opposite end of the spectrum. With 78 years of dividend stability and 24 consecutive years of increases, SO appeals to investors seeking steady income. Its regulated business model underpins earnings predictability, while its long-term guidance of 5-7% EPS growth balances income with moderate capital appreciation. Southern Company is also one of the most experienced nuclear operators in the country. Through its Southern Nuclear subsidiary, it manages eight units across Alabama and Georgia, powering millions of homes with reliable, carbon-free electricity. The completion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the first new U.S. reactors in more than three decades, was a milestone achievement. Despite years of delays and billions in overruns, the addition of these units makes Plant Vogtle the largest clean energy generator in the nation and underscores Southern’s operational resilience. Beyond Vogtle, SO operates Plant Hatch and Plant Farley, both long-running nuclear facilities recognized for their reliability and environmental stewardship. With more than 2,500 employees across its nuclear sites, Southern has built a culture of safety, innovation, and dependability. The company also invests heavily in next-generation technologies, from gas plants and battery storage to wind repowering, supported by a $76 billion five-year capital plan. However, these projects carry risks of delays and cost inflation, as Vogtle itself demonstrated. For investors, Southern Company provides a tested, lower-risk way to participate in the nuclear energy buildout. Unlike Oklo, which is years away from revenues, SO already generates close to $27 billion annually and delivered EPS of $4.05 in 2024. Its scale, stability, and proven execution set it apart in an industry often defined by uncertainty. Oklo has surged more than 400% year to date, reflecting investor enthusiasm for small modular reactors and their potential role in AI-driven energy demand. Southern Company, by comparison, has posted a modest 15% gain — steady, but nowhere near the speculative highs of OKLO. Valuations tell a similar story. OKLO trades at a lofty 22.15X price-to-book ratio, a figure that reflects hype more than earnings power. Southern Company, by contrast, trades at just 2.79X P/B, more in line with regulated utilities. The valuation gap underscores the difference: one stock is priced for aggressive growth years away, the other for stability and income today. Earnings projections show another divergence. For 2025, Southern’s EPS is expected to rise 5.4%, with another 7.4% growth in 2026. OKLO, while still pre-revenue, is projected to show 32.4% growth in 2025 before swinging to a 10.6% decline in 2026. In other words, Oklo’s earnings trajectory is highly volatile, while Southern’s remains steady and predictable. Both Oklo and Southern Company are tied to nuclear power, but they occupy very different investment profiles. Oklo offers high-risk, high-reward potential centered on future commercialization of small modular reactors, while Southern provides dependable income, proven execution, and steady growth from an already robust nuclear fleet. The stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each, making it difficult to choose a definitive winner. However, Southern Company looks slightly better placed right now — its stable revenues, predictable EPS growth, and reliable dividends offer a stronger foundation than Oklo’s long and uncertain commercialization pathway.

Indeed, in the last two days of last week, the stock fell off a cliff, with a 15% drop. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » First, a member of Oklo's board of directors, Michael Klein, recently sold 50,000 shares of Oklo for a total sale of $6.67 million. While it's not uncommon for a director to sell shares, the transaction can easily set off a chain reaction in which investors become concerned that the sale means that something unfavorable is coming. To be sure, this isn't the first time Klein has sold shares. Back in June, he sold about 300,000 shares of Oklo. As it was then, so it is now, that we simply don't know the exact rationale behind the sale. The other reason for the plummet could be ascribed to Oklo'svaluation. Oklo is a pre-revenue company with no license to operate its Aurora design commercially, yet boasts a market valuation of about $16.4 billion (as of writing on Sept. 26, 2025). Plus, its current price, Oklo trades at aprice-to-bookmultiple of about 25, nearly three times that of its closest competitorNuScale Power(NYSE: SMR). Not necessarily, though to be sure,how much you invest in Oklodepends on your risk tolerance. Again, Oklo is pre-revenue and isburning cashtp the tune of about $53 million a year. It also lacks regulatory approval to operate its Aurora powerhouse commercially. At the same time, its Aurora powerhouse seems like an AI data center's soul mate: it's modular, small, and can provide 24/7 reliable power. The company has potential, but don't expect smooth sailing.

Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » But past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and Oklo is definitely not asafe stock. In fact, its volatility can be all over the map, from days of double-digit gains to days of double-digit losses. With so much positive momentum already behind it -- and a price-to-book ratio in the low 20s -- does thisnuclear energy stockstill have room to grow, or will it fizzle out? Oklo has spent the better part of a decade designing Aurora, a compact nuclear reactor that's expected to run for 10 years without refueling. Unlike big reactors, which require huge cooling towers and long timelines for construction, Aurora is designed to be small, modular, and fairly easy to deploy. This compactness and modularity is partly why Oklo's design has garnered so much attention. Similar to how cellphones let people connect beyond the reach of landlines, Aurora could deliver power to remote areas, like mining sites and military camps, that traditional power grids don't reach. This, in turn, makes Oklo's design seem like an ideal solution for power-hungry AIdata centers(it's notable that Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, was once Oklo's board chairman). In June, the company was selected by the Department of Defense and Air Force as the apparent recipient for an Alaska-based project to build and operate the Air Force's first modular reactor. And in September, it broke ground on its first Aurora project as part of a program in Idaho sponsored by the Department of Energy. Since Oklo has not built or operated a commercial reactor, both of these opportunities give it a chance to prove that its designs can work at scale. If an AI-driven future unfolds as expected, the company could be sitting on a multibillion-dollar idea. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The hard truth is that it hasn't generated any revenue. In part that's because, while the company has strong backing, it doesn't have a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to build Aurora modular reactors commercially. And it's not expecting its first to be up and running until late 2027, which means it won't generate revenue for several years. Another potential weakness is that Aurora depends on a fuel source that is in extremely short supply outside of Russia: high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). The only commercial-scale HALEU enrichment plant under development in the U.S. is being built byCentrus Energy. Although Centrus recently delivered a sizable quantity of HALEU to the Department of Energy, it still has a long way to go before it meets the needs of a nuclear company like Oklo. Lastly, there's the money. Its cash and equivalents were around $227 million at the end of June. That gives it a runway of a few years. At the same time, building nuclear reactors -- even small ones -- is capital intensive. So investors should be prepared for more capital raises along the way, potentially diluting shares. When you see anenergy stockthat has climbed over 1,000%, it's easy to get wide-eyed and greedy. But before you buy Oklo, just consider a few things. First, the company's valuation is already high. At today's share price, itsmarket capsits between $16 billion and $17 billion. Again, this is a pre-revenue company we're talking about. Clearly, there's a lot of growth expectation already baked into the stock. Second, Oklo isn't the only front-runner in small modular reactors (SMRs). There's alsoNuScale Power, which is developing a light-water SMR and is the first U.S. company to receive NRC approval for an SMR design. And though it doesn't have a working reactor yet, it aims to have one finished by the end of the decade. Oklohas tailwinds from White House policy and the AI boom. But whether it becomes a long-term supplier of power depends on what happens between now and its first reactor coming on line.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Chicago, IL – September 29, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights EMCOR Group, Inc. EME and Oklo OKLO. Artificial intelligence is fueling the Wall Street bull market, as AI hyperscalers spend hundreds of billions of dollars building large data centers. But it’s difficult to pick winners in an AI future that remains uncertain from a long-term utilization standpoint. This is why Wall Street has bought up the energy and infrastructure stocks that are benefiting from the energy-hungry AI age, no matter which tech companies eventually win the AI arms race. EMCOR Group, Inc.profits directly from the AI hyperscale data center spending boom and the massive energy and infrastructure growth that's required to support it. EMCOR stock has soared 820% in the past five years as part of an S&P 500 and sector-crushing 4,000% surge over the past 20 years. Yet, EME’s valuation remains nearly in line with the benchmark. The electrical construction and energy infrastructure company's upward earnings revisions land it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). EMCOR is also attempting to hold a critical technical level that could help it break out and surge again in the fourth quarter after trading sideways since late July. EMCOR is a standout provider of mechanical and electrical construction services, industrial and energy infrastructure, and building services. The company boasts that it handles everything from “constructing a hyperscale data center to providing 24/7 support for a cutting-edge hospital to implementing the latest energy efficiency technologies.” The Connecticut-headquartered firm benefits directly from the AI data center spending boom, electrification, and the broader energy transition. AI hyperscalers are projected to spend roughly $400 billion in capex in 2025 alone, with global data center infrastructure spending set to hit $7 trillion by 2030. Large AI data centers consume as much electricity as a midsize city, which is a huge reason why U.S. electricity demand is set to grow by ~75% by 2050. U.S. utilities must double transmission capacity by 2050, with the country aiming to quadruple nuclear capacity over the next 25 years while expanding natural gas, solar, and more. This backdrop is whyOkloand other nuclear energy stocks have soared. But Oklo is a speculative pre-revenue nuclear energy stock. EME posted consistent revenue and earnings growth over the past 15 years outside of a Covid-based pullback. Most importantly, EMCOR’s growth (especially earnings) went into hyperdrive over the last four years as it grows with converging megatrends across technology, energy and utilities infrastructure, reshoring, and more. It averaged 13.5% YoY revenue expansion over the last four years, while its GAAP earnings per share (EPS) skyrocketed 270% from $5.76 in pre-COVID-2019 to $21.52 in 2024. EMCOR topped our EPS estimates by an average of 17% in the trailing four quarters, including a strong beat-and-raise Q2 release in late July. EME’s earnings estimates have jumped over 6% for 2025 and 2026 since its last report to extend its run of upward revisions. Its Most Accurate estimates also came in above consensus. Its overall positive earnings revisions earn EMCOR stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). EME is projected to grow its EPS by another 17% in 2025 and 8% next year, on 15% and 5%, respective sales growth. Clearly, 2026 is projected to mark a slowdown in terms of YoY growth. Yet, it’s worth stressing that EMCOR is projected to double its sales between 2020 and 2026 ($8.80 billion to $17.60 billion) and quadruple its EPS ($6.41 per share to $27 a share). EMCOR stock has ripped 1,300% higher in the last decade to blow away the S&P 500’s 250% and its Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry’s 550%. This includes its 815% climb over the past five years vs. its highly-ranked industry’s 445%. The company’s Building Products-Heavy Construction industry ranks in the top 2% of 245 Zacks industries as the space grows alongside the AI data center boom, energy expansion, and more. Being a part of a top industry boosts EMCOR’s bull case since studies have shown that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its industry group. EMCOR trades about 5% below its recent highs. The stock is attempting to hold its ground near its 50-day moving average and gap up from late July after meeting resistance at its peaks. EME could come under pressure along with Oklo and other soaring AI data center-related stocks if Wall Street decides it's finally time to take home some profits heading into the third quarter earnings season. EMCOR is a stable, dividend-paying company that trades in line with its highly-ranked industry and the S&P 500 at around 23.6X forward earnings. Any larger pullback to its late 2024 and early 2025 levels or its 200-day would mark a screaming buying opportunity for investors and traders. EMCOR stock has already cooled off a bit alongside Oklo and others, meaning it might be ready to break out of its recent range before it experiences a larger pullback. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of+48.4%, +50.2%and+56.7%per year.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Monday, President Donald Trump will meet with congressional leaders in a last-minute effort to avoid a government shutdown. Should President Trump and the Democrates fail to reach an agreement, the government will shutdown Tuesday at midnight. A government shutdown transpires when the United States Congress is unable to gather the minimum number of votes needed to pass an appropriation (payments from the US Treasury for a specific purpose) or a temporary continuing resolution to fund the federal government’s spending for the next fiscal year. When a government shutdown occurs, non-essential government employees are put on unpaid leave, essential government workers (like air traffic controllers) must work without pay (until a resolution is passed, where they receive back pay), and government services such as National Parks close. Government shutdowns are relatively rare. Over the past twenty years, there have been four major government shutdowns. History suggests that extended shutdowns are extremely rare. For instance, half of the government shutdowns over the past twenty years were resolved within three days. In 2018, the government shutdown for 35 days over a US-Mexico border dispute during the first Trump presidency. The government also shutdown for 16 days in 2013 over a congressional fight over Affordable Care Act (ACA) spending. Based on recent rhetoric from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Donald Trump, a government shutdown appears likely. In a recent NBC News interview, Schumer said,“If the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won’t get anything done.”Meanwhile, President Trump said that a shutdown is likely because“Democrats are crazed”and added“If it has to shut down, it’ll have to shutdown.” Bettors on betting website Polymarket seem to agree, with 59% predicting a government shutdown by October 1st(though the odds have dropped from a peak of 77% of bettors predicting a shutdown last week) Although government shutdowns can have a dramatic impact on government workers and produce alarming headlines, they generally have little impact on US equities. In fact,Bank of America (BAC)data indicates that the S&P 500 Index has gained ~1% on average during recent government shutdowns. Beyond the evidential price data that tells investors not to fear shutdowns, the current market conditions should be taken into account by investors. The stock market has been very bullish recently. How Strong? Stocks just completely ignored late-September seasonality trends, which are historically negative, driven by continued strength in AI stocks likeCoreWeave (CRWV)andOracle (ORCL),nuclear energy stocks likeOklo (OKLO),and quantum computing stocks likeRigetti Computing (RGTI)andIonQ (IONQ).Now with September nearly in the rearview mirror, stocks should benefit as they enter a seasonally strong period. Beyond bullish seasonality tailwind, stocks should benefit from interest rate cuts. Additionally, market breadth (participation) remains robust, with the number of S&P 500 stocks above the 20-, 50-, and 200-day moving averages increasing. Historically, deep market pullbacks with these conditions are extremely rare. While the political rhetoric makes a government shutdown seem probable, investors need not panic. Historically, these shutdowns have been short-lived and have generally had a minimal, if not positive, impact on stocks. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The advanced reactor developer's stockis getting battered this week after a research note fromGoldman Sachscautioned investors not to get ahead of themselves. The company also saw significant insider selling this week. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Amid significant investor enthusiasm for Oklo and nuclear stocks in general, Goldman Sachs analysts issued their first research note for Oklo on Wednesday, giving it a neutral rating. Goldman said that the company's business strategy needs \"de-risking\" and that thestock's valuation has outpaced reality. Along with the neutral rating, the bank set a price target of $117 per share. That represented a significant downside when the note was released, but since the stock has fallen more than 23% since Wednesday's opening bell, that target is now represents an upside. The lukewarm note from Goldman comes as several high-profile insiders unload a fairly large amount of stock. The CEO and CFO alone sold more than a combined $12 million worth of shares. I have to agree with the Goldman analysis. I think investors are getting ahead of themselves. The drop this week makes the stock more attractive, but the company's more than $16 billion market cap is still high, given that its technology is unproven and it is still pre-revenue. Still, for investors with a higher risk tolerance, Oklo can be a solid pick. Nuclear energy is having a renaissance of sorts, and the opportunity for Oklo is massive. Just know it's a long road to profitability. TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Oklo wasn’t one of them.

Cramer weighed in on the stock’s rally and its reversal, as he commented: “OKLO, another nuclear stock that I’ve been recommending. It’s up 518% for the year. When OKLO was in the 30s, I said that one good, one good headline could propel the stock to the stratosphere. Now, it’s in the 130s. Sure enough, we got that whole slew of headlines about a $1.68 billion facility in Tennessee, where Oklo will be recycling nuclear waste and fuel for its advanced reactors. The stock went to a high of 144 today before reversing hard, finishing at 131. I think Oklo is a great concept, and I say concept because it has no revenues, but I think with Oklo, here we go, okay, am I clear? We got good news today, and the stock couldn’t maintain its momentum. That’s a bad sign. The intraday reversal, suboptimal.” Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced fission power plants to deliver scalable clean energy and commercializes nuclear fuel recycling technology that transforms waste into usable reactor fuel. While we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/176977/why-wall-street-is-betting-billions-on-oklos-nuclear-vision",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Shares ofOklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO)have delivered a strong performance in 2025, with a year-to-date gain of over 550% propelling itsmarket capitalizationto exceed $20 billion. This explosive growth has made it one of the most visible and actively traded stocks in theenergy sector, commanding high trading volumes and capturing the attention of investors. Oklo's consistent stock price climbdirectly reflects its strategic position at the nexus of two critical trends: the surging power demands of theartificial intelligence(AI) industry and the broader electrification of everything, which sees electricity increasingly adopted as the preferred energy source. (Think industrial automation, electric cars, trains, planes, boats, etc.) As the world grapples with how to fuel the future of technology, Oklo is emerging as a key part of the solution, and investors are pricing in a significant long-term opportunity. Two powerful, converging forces are creating a highly favorable landscape for Oklo’s business model. The first is the undeniable energy crisis created by the electrification of everything and the rise of artificial intelligence. The data centers that power AI are voracious consumers of electricity, requiring a level of clean, 24/7 baseload power that intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar cannot guarantee. Oklo's Aurora microreactors offer a unique solution to the growing demand for reliable, on-site, carbon-free energy. Their key differentiator is the ability to provide power directly to a site, bypassing the increasingly overloaded and time-consuming power grid interconnection process. This on-site solution enables data centers to connect in months, rather than years, effectively leapfrogging existing infrastructure challenges. The second force is a historic shift in U.S. government policy. A wave of actions in 2025 has fundamentally improved the operating environment for advanced nuclear companies. The Energy and American Security Act of 2025, signed into law on July 9, 2025, established robust, long-term investment and production tax credits that can significantly improve the financial viability of first-of-a-kind projects. Additionally, a series of Executive Orders issued on May 23, 2025, directed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline its licensing review to a target of 18 months and unlocked critical government fuel stockpiles. These measures help mitigate two of the biggest historical hurdles for nuclear development: regulatory timelines and fuel access. Oklo’s strategy is built on a foundation designed for execution and long-term competitive advantage. This approach provides investors with a clear view of how the company is translating its vision into tangible progress. Oklo is not starting from a blank page. Its Aurora powerhouse is based on fast reactor designs with decades of operational history, most notably from the government's Experimental Breeder Reactor-II. These advanced reactors are more fuel-efficient and can utilize recycled fuel. This technical maturity reduces development risk and is why the company is already executing major milestones. The Sept. 22, 2025, groundbreaking at its Idaho National Laboratory site, with premier construction firm Kiewit as lead contractor, signals a clear path toward its target of beginning commercial operations in late 2027 or early 2028. Unlike traditional reactor manufacturers, Oklo plans to own and operate its powerhouses, selling power directly to customers through long-term contracts. This recurring-revenue model provides customers with long-term price stability and is highly attractive to industries that require energy certainty. The model's viability is already being validated, with the company reporting a 14 GW customer pipeline and forging strategic partnerships with data center infrastructure leaderVertiv (NYSE: VRT)and energy giantLiberty Energy (NYSE: LBRT). These collaborations are creating a direct sales channel into Oklo's primary target market. Oklo has built a multi-pronged fuel approach that creates a significant long-term cost and supply advantage, insulating it from potential bottlenecks that could affect competitors. Oklo's valuation, with a price-to-book ratio (P/B) near 67, is undeniably forward-looking. It reflects the market's assessment of the massive addressable market for powering the AI industry. While theconsensus analyst price targetsuggests some caution after the stock's rapid run-up, high-end price targets near $150 signal the significant upside potential that prominent analysts believe is possible if the company continues to execute. For investors, the primary drivers for future stock performance will be tangible progress on two fronts. First is the conversion of its substantial customer pipeline into firm, binding Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). Second is successfully navigating the key stages of the NRC’s newly streamlined licensing process. Continued execution on these fronts will validate the market's multibillion-dollar bet on Oklo's future.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Artificial intelligence is fueling the Wall Street bull market, as AI hyperscalers spend hundreds of billions of dollars building large data centers. But it’s difficult to pick winners in an AI future that remains uncertain from a long-term utilization standpoint. This is why Wall Street has bought up the energy and infrastructure stocks that are benefiting from the energy-hungry AI age, no matter which tech companies eventually win the AI arms race. EMCOR Group, Inc.EMEprofits directly from the AI hyperscale data center spending boom and the massive energy and infrastructure growth that's required to support it. EMCOR stock has soared 820% in the past five years as part of an S&P 500 and sector-crushing 4,000% surge over the past 20 years. Yet, EME’s valuation remains nearly in line with the benchmark. The electrical construction and energy infrastructure company's upward earnings revisions land it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). EMCOR is also attempting to hold a critical technical level that could help it break out and surge again in the fourth quarter after trading sideways since late July. EMCOR is a standout provider of mechanical and electrical construction services, industrial and energy infrastructure, and building services. The company boasts that it handles everything from “constructing a hyperscale data center to providing 24/7 support for a cutting-edge hospital to implementing the latest energy efficiency technologies.” The Connecticut-headquartered firm benefits directly from the AI data center spending boom, electrification, and the broader energy transition. AI hyperscalers are projected to spend roughly $400 billion in capex in 2025 alone, with global data center infrastructure spending set to hit $7 trillion by 2030. Large AI data centers consume as much electricity as a midsize city, which is a huge reason why U.S. electricity demand is set to grow by ~75% by 2050. U.S. utilities must double transmission capacity by 2050, with the country aiming to quadruple nuclear capacity over the next 25 years while expanding natural gas, solar, and more. This backdrop is why OkloOKLOand other nuclear energy stocks have soared. But Oklo is a speculative pre-revenue nuclear energy stock. EME posted consistent revenue and earnings growth over the past 15 years outside of a Covid-based pullback. Most importantly, EMCOR’s growth (especially earnings) went into hyperdrive over the last four years as it grows with converging megatrends across technology, energy and utilities infrastructure, reshoring, and more. It averaged 13.5% YoY revenue expansion over the last four years, while its GAAP earnings per share (EPS) skyrocketed 270% from $5.76 in pre-COVID-2019 to $21.52 in 2024. EMCOR topped our EPS estimates by an average of 17% in the trailing four quarters, including a strong beat-and-raise Q2 release in late July. EME’s earnings estimates have jumped over 6% for 2025 and 2026 since its last report to extend its run of upward revisions. Its Most Accurate estimates also came in above consensus.Its overall positive earnings revisions earn EMCOR stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). EME is projected to grow its EPS by another 17% in 2025 and 8% next year, on 15% and 5%, respective sales growth. Clearly, 2026 is projected to mark a slowdown in terms of YoY growth. Yet, it’s worth stressing that EMCOR is projected to double its sales between 2020 and 2026 ($8.80 billion to $17.60 billion) and quadruple its EPS ($6.41 per share to $27 a share). EMCOR stock has ripped 1,300% higher in the last decade to blow away the S&P 500’s 250% and its Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry’s 550%. This includes its 815% climb over the past five years vs. its highly-ranked industry’s 445%. The company’s Building Products-Heavy Construction industry ranks in the top 2% of 245 Zacks industries as the space grows alongside the AI data center boom, energy expansion, and more. Being a part of a top industry boosts EMCOR’s bull case since studies have shown that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its industry group. EMCOR trades about 5% below its recent highs. The stock is attempting to hold its ground near its 50-day moving average and gap up from late July after meeting resistance at its peaks. EME could come under pressure along with Oklo and other soaring AI data center-related stocks if Wall Street decides it's finally time to take home some profits heading into the third quarter earnings season. EMCOR is a stable, dividend-paying company that trades in line with its highly-ranked industry and the S&P 500 at around 23.6X forward earnings. Any larger pullback to its late 2024 and early 2025 levels or its 200-day would mark a screaming buying opportunity for investors and traders.EMCORstock has already cooled off a bit alongside Oklo and others, meaning it might be ready to break out of its recent range before it experiences a larger pullback.

Shares of Oklo dropped for a second day on Thursday, shedding 9.18 percent to close at $119.13 apiece, as investor sentiment was dampened by a combination of insider selling and an investment firm’s cautious coverage for the company. In a market note on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs urged investors to position their portfolios on Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) with caution, saying that its valuation appears full and its business strategy needs de-risking. It gave a “neutral” rating for the stock. “Over the past year, OKLO has been a catalyst-driven stock, and while we see a path for continued near-term catalysts, we believe the company needs to secure finalized customer agreements,” Goldman Sachs told its clients. At present, Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) remains a pre-revenue company that has yet to file and secure a license to build and operate its first 75-megawatt powerplant called Aurora Powerhouse. It is expected to be fully operational by late 2027 or early 2028. In other news, Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) saw its key executives disposed of positions, with its chief executive officer, Jacob DeWitte, unloading $3 million of his interest in the company in the form of a gift. Meanwhile, Director Michael Klein also sold off $6.7 million worth of his shares, while Chief Finance Officer unloaded $9.4 million worth of stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Oklo is designing microreactors that could provide 24/7 power to AI data centers. The company has policy winds at its back and recently broke ground on its first Aurora powerhouse in Idaho. Pre-revenue, with significant cash burn, this nuclear stock remains a high-risk, high-reward play. It's not every year that a nuclear start-up surges 500% year to date and still gets less chatter than the latestartificial intelligence(AI) start-up. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » The stock has gone from relative obscurity to a $19 billion market valuation in under a year, outpacing not only rivals likeNuScale(NYSE: SMR), but also Wall Street favorites likeNvidiaandPalantir. Yet unlike those big tech giants, Oklo isn't selling chips or software. In fact, as of today, it isn't selling anything at all. It's pre-revenue, pre-license, and doesn't even have a nuclear facility operating commercially. What it has, however, is an intriguing idea (plus a lot of cash): tiny reactors that can run for a decade or more on specialized fuel. It's the kind of energy that's needed for those same big tech giants that are becoming increasingly energy-hungry: a clean, reliable source for 24/7 power. That's the promise. But whether it's worth the current price or not depends on how much faith you're willing to put into Oklo's timeline and execution. Oklo is an advanced nuclear company that's developing an Aurora powerhouse, basically a small modular reactor that's expected to generate upward of 75 megawatts of power. These powerhouses are being engineered to run on a specialized fuel -- high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) -- that allows them to run for a decade or more without refueling. For context, many of today's reactors typically shut down every 1.5 to 2 years for new fuel assemblies. To be sure, Aurora's power generation (75 megawatts) is only a drop in the bucket of power that will be needed in the near future. At present,Goldman Sachs(NYSE: GS)estimates the global data center market alone consumes about 55 gigawatts (GW) of power, a number that's expected to grow to 84 GW by 2027. But therein lies Oklo's advantage. Its Aurora powerhouses are small and modular and can be assembled neardata center campuses. What's more, they can be strung together to amplify their 24/7 power generation. Since the average hyperscale data center needs 100 MW or more, a network of two or more Auroras could hypothetically meet its needs. Another interesting fact about Oklo: It aims to recycle fuel. Its planned $1.68 billion Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee is pitched as the first privately funded U.S. facility to turn nuclear waste into fresh metallic fuel. If it works, it could cutoperating costsand help Oklo secure a supply chain of what could be the equivalent of 1.3 trillion barrels of oil in recyclable fuel. All of that sounds great. Fantastic, even. But here's the kicker: Right now, Oklo's designs are mostly hypothetical, with no Aurora powerhouse governmentally sanctioned to operate. To date, the company is still trying to get regulatory approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate its Aurora design. The company applied in 2022, but was rejected for missing information on its application. In July 2025, it completed a \"pre-application readiness assessment.\" It's progress, but it's only Phase 1, and until a license is granted, the company's ideas will remain untested at scale. That's a problem for Oklo. The company isn't generating revenue and is expected toburnbetween $65 million and $80 million in cash for 2025. That said, Oklo isn't up a creek without a paddle. The White House has sent clear signals that it wants to develop and deploy advanced nuclear reactors, and Oklo's stock is in a position to benefit from it. An executive order from President Donald Trump, along with a recent joint initiative between the U.S. and U.K. to speed up safety checks on microreactors, have given Oklo a vote of confidence that could move it steadily through the regulatory process. Along those lines, Oklo's Aurora design was recently chosen by the Department of Energy to participate in a Reactor Pilot Program. Its powerhouse was one of three projects awarded (another went to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy), and it could see its first powerhouse up and running by late 2027. Indeed, as of Sept. 22, 2025, Oklo broke ground on the construction of its first Aurora in Idaho -- a relief for investors who have wanted to seesomethingmaterialize. Oklo trades at about 28 timesbook value, so it's not cheap (its rival NuScale trades at about 9 times book value). As such, a lot of expectation is already baked into today's price. Aggressive investors with a long-term perspective may want to open a small position. Others who want to capture this market but don't want to risk it all in one start-up may be better served by anuclear energy exchange-traded fund(ETF).

Extending its decline from yesterday,Oklo(NYSE: OKLO)stock is plummeting this morning as investors learn that one of the nuclear energy company's insiders sold a considerable amount of stock. As of 10:42 a.m. ET, shares of Oklo are down 8%, recovering slightly from an earlier decline of 16%. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » According to a regulatory filing that became public yesterday, Michael Klein, a member of Oklo's board of directors, sold 50,000 shares of Oklo stock on Sept. 22 in two separate transactions. Together, the two stock sales totaled about $6.7 million. Because they think that the transactions provide insight into the company's operations, investors are often attentive to members of management teams buying and selling company stock. With respect to Klein's $6.7 million sale, investors are surmising that there's something of concern with Oklo that may preclude the stock from rising in the future. While it's certainly a worthy endeavor to watch for the stock purchases and sales of management teams, it's important to recognize that there's more than one reason for an insider to sell company stock. Sure, insiders may feel that the companies have dark days ahead, so they feel compelled to sell shares before they plunge. But that's not the only reason. An insider may simply want to free up cash for personal reasons -- unrelated to any opinions they have about the company's future. ForOklo investors, today's news is certainly worth acknowledging, but it by no means should be interpreted as a signal that the company will be reporting disastrous news in the days (or weeks) ahead. Should several insiders also sell their shares, however, investors may want to revisit their own positions. Oklo shareholders who are still uneasy with the insiders sale could also consider if choosing to invest in anuclear energy exchange-traded fund(ETF) will help them sleep better at night.

Developing its first small modular reactor deployment, Oklo has a robust pipeline of future customers. Investors have to identify their investment goals before deciding which stock is best for them. Red-hot in 2025, nuclear energy stocks have been in high demand, and investors' interest don't seem likely to taper off anytime soon. Besides the auspicious futures that nuclear energy companies are projecting, political support for this niche of the renewable energy industry is powering the market's interest. Most recently, this came in the form of a partnership between the U.S. and U.K. during President Trump's to England to facilitate development of advanced nuclear reactors. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » But where specifically should investors interested in nuclear energy exposure turn? Two popular nuclear energy stocks,Cameco(NYSE: CCJ)andOklo(NYSE: OKLO), are both industry leaders that command attention. Let's see which is a better investment opportunity. While strong political support is driving interest in upstart nuclear energy companies, it's important to remember that the industry is decades old. During that time, Cameco has emerged as the dominant player. With a $37.5 billionmarket cap, Cameco operates in various links of the nuclear energy value chain. From its upstream uranium operations in Canada, the U.S., Australia, and Kazakhstan to its fuel manufacturing services for both light water reactors and heavy water reactors, Cameco's extensive reach is considerable. Those looking to power their portfolios with a less speculative option will undoubtedly find this well-established company appealing. After its $2.1 billion acquisition of a 49% equity stake in Westinghouse in 2023, Cameco has recognized a significant improvement in its financials with respect to both revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); and free cash flow. Management's interest in maintaining a strong balance sheet and not relying heavily on leverage provides further evidence of Cameco's strong financial health. At the end of June 2025, Cameco had net debt of $280 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2. While it plays a pivotal role in the operations of traditional nuclear power plants, Cameco also has an opportunity to benefit from the development of some small modular reactor (SMR) projects. Illustrating its interest in SMR technology, Cameco announced a partnership with SMR developerX-Energyto explore ways in which it could support the company's deployment of SMRs in Canada and the U.S. Artificial intelligence(AI) continues growing in popularity, and data center companies are struggling to fortify their infrastructures in support of AI computing's high power demands. This situation is the foundation for why investors have raced to SMR developers like Oklo. Already making progress toward gaining a foothold in this market, Oklo is partnering with data center infrastructure specialistVertivto explore power and cooling solutions designed for AI-specific data centers, using steam and electricity from Oklo's Aurora powerhouse SMRs. And it's not only Vertiv that recognizes Oklo as a valuable partner. In Oklo's second quarter 2025 10-Q, the company stated it has recently \"executed two other nonbinding letters of intent to provide an additional 750 MWe [megawatts of electricity] of energy for data center customers, which could bring our current total order book of Aurora powerhouses to approximately 14,100 MWe in capacity -- nearly a 2,000% increase since our business combination announcement in July 2023.\" While SMRs like Oklo's Aurora powerhouses may seem like the stuff of the future, the company recently reported progress in bringing its vision to fruition. On Sept. 22, Oklo announced that it has broken ground on its first Aurora powerhouse at Idaho National Laboratory -- a project that the company foresees commencing operations in late 2027 or early 2028. There's no confusion about why Cameco and Oklo are glowing considerations forenergy investorsright now. On the other hand, it's certainly understandable why investors may feel conflicted about which stock to choose as an investment. For those who have a lowerrisk tolerance, Cameco is a much better choice at this point; however, growth investors who are comfortable carving out a niche of their portfolios for a more speculative investment would be smart to buy Oklo. It's worth noting, though, that the most cautious of investors may feel more comfortable opting for anuclear energy ETFinstead of Cameco if they're looking to mitigate risk.

Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Let's take a closer look at how Oklo and Bitcoin stack up, and assess which opportunity offers better long-term value in the AI era. AI demands energy consumption on an unprecedented scale. Data centers powered by clusters of GPUs fromNvidiaandAdvanced Micro Devicesrequire enormous amounts of electricity, forcing companies to look beyond traditional power sources. This is where nuclear enters the conversation. With its ability to provide reliable baseload power and its low-carbon profile, nuclear is increasingly viewed as a compelling candidate for long-term AI infrastructure investment. Oklo has emerged at the center of this narrative. The company is developing next-generation microreactors designed to address AI's looming energy bottleneck. The excitement around this vision has propelled Oklo intomeme stockterritory -- fueled more by investor enthusiasm than measurable results. For instance, shares surged nearly 20% in a single day last week after the United States and the United Kingdom announced a$350 billion AI infrastructure venture. While the deal includes energy initiatives, Oklo was not explicitly mentioned. On the other side of the speculative spectrum is Bitcoin. Where Oklo represents a potential solution to AI's energy requirements, Bitcoin offers something entirely different: digital scarcity. With a hard-capped supply of just21 million coins, Bitcoin fits neatly into the \"digital gold\" narrative -- cementing itself as a modern store of value. What makes Bitcoin's rise during the AI revolution especially meaningful is the policy and institutional backdrop. A pro-crypto Trump administration,treasury strategies that add Bitcoin to corporate balance sheets, sovereign nations exploring the creation ofstrategic reserves, and the approval ofspot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)have all converged to accelerate mainstream adoption. Together, these factors are fueling Bitcoin's momentum across Wall Street, corporate America, and retail investors like never before. Bitcoin also benefits from its perception as ahedge against inflation. In a market where investments are increasingly concentrated among big tech, some are seeking alternative assets that can thrive alongside the AI boom. The performance gap between Oklo and Bitcoin is startling. Since the dawn of the AI boom, Oklo stock has skyrocketed by an astonishing 1,290% as of market close on Sept. 19. Over the same period, Bitcoin has gained 491%. Even more striking, since Oklo went public through aspecial purpose acquisition company(SPAC) last May, its shares have outperformed Bitcoin nearly sevenfold. On the surface, it looks as though Oklo is leaving Bitcoin in the dust. But does thisreallymake the red-hot energy stock a better investment? Oklo has yet to deliver a commercial product and tangible results are still years away. Its meteoric rise highlights a broader truth about today's growth investors: Many are no longer chasing profits -- they are chasing narratives. The reality is that Oklo remains a high-risk gamble on the future of AI infrastructure. On the other hand, Bitcoin already has proven utility, global liquidity, and increasing adoption. Looked at differently, this means that Bitcoin's value isn't stemming solely from speculative hype-driven narratives. In my view, this makes Bitcoin's place in institutional and retail portfolios more legitimate compared to Oklo, which largely remains a pipe dream. As financial services and payments infrastructure are disrupted by AI, Bitcoin should continue evolving from a peripheral novelty into a legitimate global asset class. While investing in cryptocurrency still carries its share of risk, Bitcoin offers a more grounded opportunity with measurable upside compared to Oklo at the moment.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Oklo is developing advanced nuclear energy solutions known as small modular reactors (SMRs). Shares of Oklo have soared in 2025, but the company is still waiting to receive the necessary regulatory approvals to start operations. Investors with lower tolerances for risk may want to consider investing in a nuclear energy ETF. When the market's fervor sends growth stocks soaring, sometimes it feels that the rides will last forever. Of course, they won't. Investors are getting a taste of that today withOklo(NYSE: OKLO)stock, which is heading lower for no reason in particular. As of 12:10 p.m. ET, shares of the nuclear energy stock are down 4%, paring back an earlier decline of 6.5%. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Investorenthusiasm for Oklo stock has been considerable in 2025as political support for advanced nuclear small modular reactors (SMRs) continues to grow. However, much of the stock's extraordinary rise this year has been predicated on the company'spotential-- not material gains. UnlikeNuScalePower(NYSE: SMR), Oklo doesn't have an SMR design that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved, and its path to commencing commercial operations is a lot more fraught with risk than some of its nuclear energy peers. While the bulls are enthusiastic about the company's prospects, some are recognizing that Oklo stock has gotten ahead of itself. Yesterday, for example, Seaport Research downgraded the stock to neutral due to the stock's high valuation. It's quite likely that Main Street investors are recognizing Seaport Research's perspective as a more reasonable take on the stock than the bulls who continue to pile into the stock. WhileOklo stockis dipping lower today, it doesn't mean that those who had been on the sidelines should step in and click the buy button. There are still considerable hurdles that the company must overcome before it starts generating revenue -- let alone a profit. Cautious investorswho are interested in nuclear energy exposure should recognize that they have other opportunities than Oklo, or even NuScale Power, which has its own set of risks.Nuclear energy exchange-traded funds(ETFs), for example, are a great option for those who seek a more conservative investment option.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Palantir's AI platform is generating real revenue with 48% growth and GAAP profitability, while Oklo won't see revenue until 2027. Oklo's microreactors could solve AI's power bottleneck, but licensing and construction risks make it a multiyear speculation. Palantir offers the cleaner AI exposure after risk adjustment, though Oklo's 1,568% surge over the prior 12 months shows market appetite for the power thesis. Two stocks, two very differentartificial intelligence (AI) plays.Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)is monetizing AI software today.Oklo(NYSE: OKLO)aims to supply thenuclear powerAI will need tomorrow. With Palantir up 382% and Oklo surging 1,568% over the past 12 months, investors clearly see opportunity in both. But which of these high-poweredgrowth stocksdeserves your capital right now? Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Palantir is firing on all cylinders. Second-quarter 2025 revenue jumped 48% year over year (YOY) to reach new highs, with U.S. commercial revenue surging 93% YOY -- showing where the real acceleration is happening. The company postedGAAP earningsof $0.13 per share and achieved GAAP profitability -- actual profits, not adjusted metrics. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (aka AIP) has moved from pilot programs to production deployments across commercial enterprises. The edge lies in combining secure data integration with customizable AI tools, a combination that resonates with both governments and enterprises navigating strict compliance requirements. Management guided third-quarter growth to 50% YOY and raised full-year 2025 revenue guidance. This isn't speculative AI potential; Palantir is an at-scale software vendor with accelerating commercial adoption and expanding margins. Oklo operates in a different universe. The company has no commercial revenue yet and doesn't expect first power until late 2027 or early 2028, pending licensing. Instead of software, Oklo is developing Aurora microreactors -- 75-megawatt, liquid-metal-cooled fast reactors designed to provide always-on, site-level power fordata centersand defense customers. The thesis is compelling: As AI compute scales up, electricity -- not chips -- has become the constraint. U.S. data centers already consume 4.4% of electricity and could reach 6.7% to 12% by 2028. Last year, Oklo signed a nonbinding 12-gigawatt framework agreement with the premier AI provider Switch. It was also named the intended awardee for a U.S. Air Force Alaska microreactor contract, conditional on Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing. If Aurora clears regulatory and build hurdles, Oklo could be a first mover in distributed, carbon-free baseload power -- precisely what hyperscale AI sites require. Here's where paths diverge sharply. Palantir trades at rich multiples -- the price of proven execution in a red-hot market. But you're buying a business generating cash today with clear quarterly milestones. The main risk isn't just valuation compression but whether AIP adoption outside the U.S. can scale at the same pace as domestic growth. Oklo is purestory stock. No revenue model exists to value it traditionally. Share price swings entirely on regulatory updates, partnership announcements, and broader nuclear sentiment. Beyond licensing delays and construction risks, financing remains a question mark -- building reactors requires massive capital. Any setback could crater the stock. Yet if Oklo delivers on its vision, early investors could see transformational returns in the decades ahead. Oklo's appeal stems from AI's emerging bottleneck: electricity.Nvidia's recent $100 billion OpenAI partnership highlighted the need for nuclear-reactor-scale power. That dynamic makes Oklo's microreactor promise tantalizing for investors seeking the next constraint trade. But timing matters. Oklo's first 75-megawatt reactor won't deploy until late 2027 at best. Nuclear projects historically tend to face delays. Meanwhile, Palantir generates returns quarterly. For investors seeking the better AI stock today, Palantir wins. It has visible revenue, expanding margins, and real customers generating actual returns. Oklo is a lottery ticket -- potentially transformative, but years away from proving its model. Smart portfolios might include both, but if you're choosing one, pick the company making money now over the one promising reactors later. In AI's evolution, execution beats aspiration -- and right now, Palantir is executing while Oklo is still building its case.

All the holdings underneath were lumped together, painted with a broader brush as ‘higher’ on rate-cut momentum. The team always gets the credit for a win, but let’s talk about the star players. Up first, a shoutout toTop 2025 pickBloom Energy Corp (NYSE:BE), the second-highest holding for the small cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley nearly doubled its price target on BE to $85 from $44. The analyst in coverage cited the partnership with Oracle (ORCL), and Bloom’s fuel cells operating the massive power needs of AI data centers. BE closed the week at $82.93, up 273% in 2025. The fourth-largest IWM holding isIonQ Inc (NYSE:IONQ), thequantum computing maven. Quantum computing has gone from fast-tracked tech of the future to fugazi, fifty times over, all in the last five years. On Wednesday, IonQ announced intentions to acquire Vector Atomic and completed the acquisition of Oxford Ionics. They followed those moves up on Thursday with a memorandum of understanding with Department of Energy to advance quantum technologies in space. IONQ is in the midst of a seven-day win streak and crossed $70 briefly on Friday. Sector peersRigetti Computing Inc (NYSE:RGTI)andD-Wave Quantum Inc (NYSE:QBTS)are also notable holdings in IWM, and added 49% and 51% this week, due to not only a halo lift but their own tailwinds: Rigetti was awarded a three-year, $5.8 million contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory. D-Wave highlighted 83% year over year growth in the Asia-Pacific region at its Qubits Japan 2025 conference in Tokyo. Everything came up quantum this week. No doubt a correction or at the very least some consolidation is coming, but beyond the equity gains, this week was all about the companies planting their flags in the ground, from a legitimacy perspective. It’s even more critical for such a growth sector that saw IONQ and QBTS suffer post-earnings drawdowns of 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively. (Rigetti somehow skated by and gapped higher by 6.1% after earnings). Another star isOklo Inc (NYSE:OKLO), the seventh-largest equity holding in IWM and up almost 60% this week alone. Oklo is the Sam Altman-backed,small-module reactorcompany that’s driving the nuclear energy sector. Uranium stocks got an early-week lift after U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced plans to increase the national strategic uranium stockpile. For OKLO, that meant increased downstream demand. On Thursday, the U.S.-U.K. nuclear energy pact gave clean energy stocks another shot in the arm. And similar to the quantum halo lift,Nano Nuclear Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NNE)finished with a weekly gain of 15%. What’s the common thread between clean energy, quantum computing, and nuclear reactor stocks? All six have shown up on Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White’s Short Squeeze screen in the last two reporting periods. Yet despite all these crazy gains this week, all six of those names still have short interest/float (SI/F) ratios of 10% or more. Again, this is after all the melt ups. This was double the average daily options volume. The VIX has been asleep all September, logging only six wins and never trading higher than 17.50.\n        Per Trade-Alert, the most active contract during that Tuesday pop was the November 55 call, which, wow.

Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Oklo stock has been on a tear this year, rising nearly 16-fold over 12 months, and Campbell acknowledged the company's recent groundbreaking for its firstnuclear reactor pilot projectat Idaho National Laboratory is a positive for the stock. Nevertheless, the rapid rise of Oklo stock -- in the absence of profit, or indeed revenue, and with most analysts forecasting nothing but losses for the next five years -- does give the analyst pause. Says Campbell: \"While we continue to see a number of positives in Oklo's business development, we are stepping to the sidelines for now, based on the current stock valuation.\" That's a curious statement, though. As I just mentioned, Oklo stock is up 15x in value over 12 months, and now costs more than $20 billion. Campbell apparently thinks this is too much to pay for the stock, but the question must be asked: $20 billion is too much to pay fora start-up stockwith no profits. Agreed. But what about when Oklo stock cost half as much as it did today -- $69 a share? Wasn't $10 billion also too much to pay for a profitless stock? Or how about half that amount -- $34.50? Was $5 billion perhaps too much to pay?

Oklo(NYSE: OKLO)stock soared by 29% on Friday after the Trump administration and the government of the United Kingdom announced agreements to speed up the development of the two countries'artificial intelligence,quantum computing, andnuclear energy sectors. Last week, I called that market response an overreaction because the U.K.-U.S. agreement won't benefit Oklo directly (or at all) -- and in fact appears most likely to benefit anAmazon-backedrival nuclear power company called X-Energy.

Did my warning last week set off this mild retreat? I doubt it. More likely, what we're seeing is simply evidence ofmomentum traders, who won big on Friday, selling Oklo stock to pocket their winnings. What's really curious, though, is that Oklo stock is now falling on some actual good news. On Monday, Oklo will break ground on its first Aurora powerhouse at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), the \"Aurora-INL\" sodium-cooled fast reactor. As the company reminded in its press release, Aurora-INL is one of three nuclear pilot projects that Oklo and its subsidiaries have been awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Still, Oklo remains a long way away from getting any revenues (much less profits) from this project. As the company itself admits, it has completed only \"two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility.\" The company hasn't stated when Aurora-INL will come on line and begin producing positive numbers for Oklo, but most analysts agree the company is at least five years away from profitability.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Oklo Inc.(OKLO) has captured headlines with its ambitious Aurora powerhouse plans, but the company remains firmly in the pre-revenue stage. Its commercialization pathway runs directly through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, where approvals are known to take years. Even under optimistic scenarios, OKLO’s first revenue-generating unit is unlikely before 2027-2028. That leaves investors with a long wait as quarterly losses continue, raising questions about whether enthusiasm can endure such an extended runway. The challenge is not just time, but execution. Nuclear projects require near-perfect coordination across safety reviews, site preparation, fuel sourcing, and contractor performance. Any delay in licensing or setbacks in construction could stretch OKLO’s already lengthy schedule. History shows nuclear builds often run into overruns and slippages, which can erode market confidence quickly. Meanwhile, peers likeNuScale Power(SMR) are already advancing toward deployment milestones, preparing to capture early commercial opportunities that OKLO has yet to reach. Adding to the competitive backdrop,Rolls-Royce(RYCEY) is aggressively advancing its small modular reactor (“SMR”) program, with support from the UK and Czech governments. Rolls-Royce has argued that its modular design reduces risks and costs compared with some mega-projects. The company has already secured sovereign funding and utility partnerships, while also tying its SMR strategy to meet rising demand from AI data centers. With Rolls-Royce projecting that hundreds of units could be needed globally by 2050, its initiatives underscore how fast-moving competitors may narrow the runway for Oklo’s long-term opportunity set. The tension becomes clear when looking at market values. OKLO’s market capitalization has now surpassed NuScale’s and stands at roughly 50% higher, even though NuScale is further along in commercializing its technology and moving toward revenue generation. This mismatch highlights the risk embedded in Oklo’s stock: investors are paying for potential that is still years away. Unless the company demonstrates tangible progress toward deployment, its lofty valuation could prove difficult to sustain in a market that often loses patience with long-dated promises. From a valuation perspective— in terms of the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B) ratio — Oklo is trading at a significant premium compared to the industry average.The company carries a Value Score of F.

Does Oklo have some kind of magic, or is the company's almost $20 billion market cap a mirage? Oklo is designing an advanced \"microreactor.\" These reactors (called \"Aurora\" powerhouses) are being engineered to run on both high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and recycled nuclear fuel, a one-two punch that should make them not only more efficient but less wasteful than traditional nuclear reactors. Their compact and modular design means that they could be assembled near AI data center campuses and other remote areas, like military bases and mining sites. Oklo has also expanded into radioisotope production with its acquisition of Atomic Alchemy. The goal is to produce medical isotopes domestically to \"address urgent supply shortages.\" For a pre-revenue company like Oklo, it could mean generating revenue before its powerhouses are online. And therein lies the kicker: Oklo's Aurora powerhouses don't have regulatory approval, and Oklo hasn't built a commercially operable full-scale Aurora reactor yet. It's also bleeding cash (an expected $65 million to $80 millioncash burnfor 2025) and may not generate revenue on its powerhouses until decade's end. Lucky for Oklo, the White House is bullish on nuclear energy. In early summer, President Donald Trump signed executive orders furthering the development of advanced nuclear reactors. And recently, the U.S. and U.K. governments jointly signed an initiative to accelerate safety checks on small modular reactors and microreactors -- Oklo's bread and butter. It's worth pointing out thatNuScale Power, an SMR designer, also surged on the same news. For now, Oklo is a speculative play on clean energy.

When suggesting nuclear stocks, Cramer mentioned the company and said: “What [are] examples of what speculation means?… Second kind of speculation, thesis stocks. Case in point, America’s short on power. We need every kind of energy… We need nuclear? That’s Oklo.” Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced fission power plants to deliver scalable clean energy and commercializes nuclear fuel recycling to convert waste into usable reactor fuel. During the September 9 episode, Cramer said that he does not think that the company’s stock is “done going higher,” as he remarked: “Then viewers urged me to focus on nuclear power. When I looked up over, when I looked over the group, I found one that seemed like a serious spec, Oklo, which is building small form nuclear reactors. Given the high demand for electricity thanks to the data center buildout, which we heard just again tonight with Oracle, and the fact that Oklo’s a company with significant customer interest, I decided to suspend my critical judgment. And I told you that it might take only one positive headline for this stock to rock, and sure enough, a $33 stock gapped up when it was selected for a DoD contract. I don’t think it’s done going higher.” While we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Its stock is overvalued, given that it has zero revenue today and will likely not generate any revenue in five years. Nuclear energyhas come back from the dead, led by the soaring demand for electricity from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.Oklo(NYSE: OKLO)is a nuclear energy start-up trying to take advantage of this great need. As a so-called \"fast fission\" developer, the company is in the middle of planning and certification for a nuclear power plant design, nuclear waste recycling, and producing radioisotopes. Investors have taken notice. At $129.50 a share, Oklo stock trades up 1,980% compared to a year ago, when it went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger. Where will the stock be five years from now? Let's dig into the numbers and find out. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Oklo's Aurora Powerhouse is a modular nuclear reactor with upwards of 75 megawatts (MW) of power generation. With reliable power that is on 100% of the time, 75 MW of power can fulfill the electricity needs of thousands of homes, which can be scaled up due to the modular design of these systems. Besides the Aurora Powerhouse, Oklo is working on a nuclear fuel recycling project in Tennessee. This project will be used to produce fuel that will go into the Aurora Powerhouse reactors, and potentially other nuclear systems. Electric grid analysts expect the United States to need more than 80 gigawatts (GW) of new energy capacity over the next 20 years (one gigawatt equals 1,000 megawatts). That is an immense opportunity for nuclear energy companies like Oklo. The U.S. government is trying to speed up the process of building these reactors, with multiple executive orders from the Trump administration aimed at supercharging the nuclear energy market in the country. Time will tell how much of an effect this will have on actual development, though. Since it's still in the approval process with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Oklo is unable to build any Aurora Nuclear power plants today. It has plans to do so at some point before 2030, but that won't happen until full certification is awarded. Beginning construction is just the next step. Nuclear power plants can take years -- if not a decade -- to finish. This means that Oklo may not generate any revenue over the next five to 10 years. Today, it is generating zero in revenue and burning $53 million infree cash flow. Its cash burn has increased in recent years as it scales up research and certification spending. Once it starts building a power plant, cash burn is going to look even worse in the interim. With over $500 million in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet, Oklo is not going to run out of money anytime soon. Just don't expect it to generate any revenue, either. Nuclear power is a slow-moving market. After rising nearly 2,000% in 12 months, Oklo now has amarket capof $19.2 billion. Its shares outstanding keep rising due to common stock offerings, which will increase its market cap without the share price going higher. It is hard to value Oklo stock because it generates zero revenue. However, we do know that in five years it will likely also be generating zero in revenue since it still hasn't gotten the Aurora plant approved by the NRC. That is zero dollars inrevenue, let alone thinking about generating a profit. Even if Oklo begins building nuclear power plants, it is unclear why it deserves a $19-plus billion market cap. These are capital-intensive projects with slim margins. If profits materialize at all, it will be over a decade from now. With this context, it is clear that investors should avoid buying Oklo stock, as it is extremely overvalued at current prices and may never generate any revenue.

Investors are excited by the company's Aurora powerhouse and fuel recycling plans. The company is pre-revenue and hasn't gotten regulatory approval to operate a nuclear reactor commercially.

Instead, it's the advanced nuclear companyOklo(NYSE: OKLO). Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » When anuclear energy stockclimbs over 320% on the year, it's sure to turn some heads. But whether Oklo is worth adding to your portfolio or not will depend on a few things -- and your belief in a future of nuclear energy is only the beginning. Oklo is building what it calls \"Aurora\" powerhouses. These small, factory-built nuclear reactors are designed to run on high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), a type of fuel that lasts longer than the lower enrichments used in traditional light-water reactors today. How much longer are we talking? Well, to give you an idea: Oklo expects its Aurora powerhouses to run for a decade or more without refueling. Many of today's nuclear power plants are refueled every 18 to 24 months. At that rate, a light-water reactor would need to be refueled five times before Oklo's Aurora is refueled once. In addition to power generation, Oklo is also expanding into nuclear fuel recycling. The expectation is that Oklo will convert used nuclear fuel into new reactor fuel, potentially saving up to 80% of the company's fuel costs, according to Oklo's estimates. In line with this plan, Oklo recently announced that it was building the U.S.'s first privately funded nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, an estimated $1.68 billion project that could boost Oklo's fuel security when it's finished in the early 2030s. To be sure, Oklo's advanced technology alone isn't what's exciting investors. It's the potential for this technology to power anenergy-hungry future. Electricity demand in the U.S. is expected to grow 3.2% annually through 2030 and 2.2% annually through 2050 (from 2023 levels), according to ICF. At that rate, U.S. installed generation capacity needs to grow 3.3% every year between 2025 and 2050. Considering that this capacity only grew 1.8% over the last 25 years, it's clear we'll need more than the traditional blend of power generation to keep up. Of course, that doesn't mean advanced nuclear power will bethesupply solution to surging demand. A plethora of sources (solar, wind, geothermal, hydro) will likely be needed. But advanced nuclear could become optimal for a major part of that future demand, particularly the around-the-clock needs created by AI and data centers. And this, finally, is where Oklo is expected to shine. AI data centers will need 24/7, clean power, and Oklo's Aurora powerhouse is small and modular enough to be assemblednearbyto give it to them. Partnerships with Switch andEquinix,two big names in AI data infrastructure, underscores Oklo's appeal to some of the sector's heaviest power users. Here's a quick reality check on Oklo. Although it has big ideas and potential, it doesn't have a commercially available product. Its expectedcash burnfor 2025 will be between $65 to $80 million And since it's not generating revenue, it'll rely on its cash and cash-equivalent securities, which were a little less than $227 million at the end of June. What's worse, Oklo could beat leasttwo years away from generating any meaningful revenue, with its first operational reactor not expected until late 2027. A big reason for this is that it needs the blessing of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to start deploying its design in the U.S. While Oklo is working through the process to obtain that license, there's not a clear date for when it will have one. Toss in the fact that Oklo's rival,NuScale, already has a Standard Design Approval (SDA) for two of its small modular reactor (SMR) designs, and the clock ticking down resounds a little bit louder. Until Oklo has a license for its Aurora design, its advanced nuclear technology will remain untested at scale. Given that its market cap is nearing $14 billion, and with no revenue to show for it, this stock remains a speculative play for aggressivegrowth investors.

According to CFO Sarah Friar, in July, the company notched its first billion-dollarrevenuemonth. Given how popularartificial intelligence (AI)is right now, that's not surprising. What is surprising is how much more the company could have earned if it wasn't lacking a resource that CEO Sam Altman says the company will spend \"trillions of dollars\" on developing in the \"not very distant future.\" Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Here's what's holding OpenAI back and why startupOklo(NYSE: OKLO)may be on track to win a significant share of those trillions. The biggest obstacle to OpenAI's scalability right now, according to Friar, is access to power, both computing power from powerful GPUs made byNvidiaand the electric power required to run thedata centers. \"In terms of AI, it is voracious right now for GPUs and for [computing power],\" said Friar in an August interview. \"The biggest thing we face is being constantly 'under compute.' That's why we launched Stargate. That's why we're doing the bigger builds.\" But Friar doesn't think the current system is sustainable. \"We have to do a lot to figure out how to make data centers more efficient, to think about new ways to power them,\" OpenAI's CFO said. And that's where Oklo comes in. It's telling that Friar specifically referenced finding \"new ways to power\" data centers, because most existing electricity sources are already being used. For example,Microsoft-- which has invested $11 billion in OpenAI -- has poured money into building newsolar farmsto power data centers. It and many other AI-focused companies have also signed contracts withnuclear powerplant operators for a guaranteed allocation of their generation capacity. Several data centers are located near hydroelectric dams to ensure reliable supplies of both electricity and water for cooling systems. And, of course, coal andnatural gas-fired power plants are currently the primary providers of grid power in the U.S. However, Oklo has proposed one of the few truly \"new\" ways to power a data center: with a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR). While traditional nuclear facilities have massive footprints to house their giant reactors, SMRs can be housed in much smaller facilities. Oklo recently announced a partnership with engineering companyVertivto develop cooling systems for data centers powered by onsite SMRs that would cool both the servers and the reactor. A lot of companies are working on SMRs, and while none have yet been able to produce a working prototype -- primarily because of the multi-year regulatory process for all things nuclear -- Oklo has existing ties to OpenAI that would likely place it first in line for OpenAI investment. Oklo went public via a merger with one of Sam Altman'sspecial purpose acquisition corporations (SPACs). Altman himself was chairman of the Oklo board until April, when he stepped down to allow the company to pursue deals with other AI companies without a conflict of interest. The company believes it could have a working prototype by 2027 or possibly even 2026. Once it's able to prove its technology works, it will likely open the floodgates for investment by power-hungry AI companies like OpenAI. While there's certainly some risk -- the company's design could have unforeseen flaws -- investors who buy in now will have the chance at the biggest rewards.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Oklo is developing a small modular reactor (SMR) called Aurora, which could provide 24/7 power to remote sites like data centers. Centrus Energy is a U.S. supplier of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) -- the fuel needed to power most SMRs. After decades on the sidelines, nuclear is suddenly back in the conversation. A couple of reasons can explain its sudden resurgence: One, it's a zero-emission energy source, and, two, it can support energy-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) data centers with reliable 24/7 power. As a result, governments are pumping billions to increase nuclear energy capacity, with the White House recently taking executive action to \"reinvigorate\" its domestic nuclear supply chain. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » Those two tailwinds, plus others, are making quite a few nuclear energy companies seem like no-brainers for investors betting on an energy intensive future. If you're looking to open a stake in the most intriguing opportunities, here are twonuclear energy stocksto watch. Oklo(NYSE: OKLO)is a nuclear start-up that's widely seen as a pioneer in advanced nuclear technology. Although the company is pre-revenue -- and isn't expected to generate revenue until 2027 -- the stock is up over 1,360% year over year, with a $13.4 billionmarket valuationto go with it. What's exciting investors about Oklo is the promise that its bread-and-butter technology, small modular reactors (SMRs), will be the most fitting energy source for AI data centers. Oklo's SMRs are small, modular reactors that take up less space than mostgreen energy sources(like wind farms) and can be assembled faster than traditional reactors. They use a novel fuel technology that can supposedly run for about 10 years, which makes them ideal for remote off-grid sites. And although they're small, they can also be chained together to provide more power if needed. But here's the kicker. Oklo's flagship microreactor, Aurora, has been tested, but currentlynonehave been built for commercial customers. The company hit a regulatory snag in 2022 -- its license application was denied by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- and is currently completing a new application. Until it gets past all the regulatory hurdles, its designs will be promising but untested at scale. At the same time, Oklo has friends in high places. It has a letter of intent for a 20-year power deal withDiamondback Energyand a strategic partnership withCentrus Energy(NYSEMKT: LEU). The latter partnership includes purchasing high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) in exchange for electricity purchased from it to power Centrus' production facility in Piketon, Ohio. Oklo was also chosen by the White House as part of a new slate of federally supported nuclear projects. Most notably, three of the 11 projects selected were Oklo's -- the only company to have more than one. As such, Oklo remains a speculative play, a pre-revenue company whose valuation is already high but whose promise could be much worth much more than what it trades at today. If Oklo is a designer reinventing the nuclear reactor from the ground up, then Centrus is the fuel supplier making it possible. Indeed, Centrus is the only U.S.-owned enricher who's licensed to make high-assay low-enriched uranium, which just so happens to be the very fuel that most next-generation reactors will require when they are put to commerical use. HALEU is enriched between 5% and 20% U-235. This is a higher energy density than what most traditional reactors were engineered to require, but not nearly as volatile as weapons-grade material. In practice, it means smaller reactors can run longer between refueling and generate less waste. Currently, the U.S. imports most of its enriched uranium from Russia and France. As you can imagine, this is an uncomfortable fact for the White House. While Centrus also imports some Russian LEU, the hope is that it will, with government support, obtain self-sufficiency in production. On that front, the Piketon facility is pulling off some early heavy lifting. Over the last six years, Centrus has built 16 advanced centrifuges, gotten regulatory approval to enrich uranium up to 19.75%, and delivered nearly 1 metric ton (900 kgs) of HALEU to U.S. Department of Energy. The DOE has now extended its contract with Centrus into Phase III, with options for up to eight more years of production. If all goes well with Phase III, it could establish Centrus as the U.S.'s domestic supplier of HALEU. Like Oklo, however, Centrus is still a speculative play. For one, the stock trades at a premium: about 56 timesforward earnings, or almost 4 times higher than the energy sector's average rate of about 15. It sits on about $833 million in cash and a $3.6 billion backlog, but its capacity to produce enriched uranium is limited and needs successful expansion to meet expected demands. For investors betting that future is powered by nuclear power, both of those stocks are compelling high-risk buys for $100. More cautious investors who want to limit downside risk, however, might want to consider anuclear energy exchange traded-fund(ETF).

Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » A memorandum of understanding between the two countries was made public on Thursday, outlining collaboration on nuclear energy development. The agreement emerged from President Trump's U.K. visit this week, where nuclear energy and artificial intelligence (AI) were the dominant topics. The U.K. plans to slash its reactor licensing timeline from three to four years down to just two years, while the U.S. has set an 18-month target for review procedures. That's a massive acceleration that could fundamentally change how quickly companies like Oklo can deploy their small modular reactors. The agreement also targets Russia's dominance in nuclear fuel supply. Both nations are committed to eliminating Russian fuel imports by 2028. Energy Secretary Chris Wright indicated at a Vienna conference this week that he'd pursue similar partnerships with other nations. The opportunity for Oklo is massive. Nuclear energy is having a renaissance of sorts, and with its compact fast reactor design, Oklo could be particularly well-positioned to benefit from streamlined licensing. Still, the company's valuation makes me pause. Oklo has yet to generate meaningful revenue and trades on promise rather than performance. The technology still needs to be perfected, and there's no guarantee that successive administrations will be as pro-nuclear as the current one.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Oklo Inc.OKLOstock has soared nearly 100% in a month as the home-run next-generation nuclear energy company benefits from the artificial intelligence-driven energy boom. AI hyperscalers and the U.S. government are spurring a nuclear energy revival to help fuel AI expansion, which is sending energy demand skyrocketing. Wall Street recognizes that nuclear energy is a critical part of the broader AI trade and the growing energy and infrastructure spending boom. Oklo appears to be a long-term nuclear energy winner. However, Oklo is potentially overheated following its recent surge (including a +20% rally on Friday morning). Oklo trades at its most overbought RSI levels of the past 12 months and miles above its 50-day moving average. Plus, the Sam Altman-backed nuclear energy company is pre-revenue. Investors who don’t want to chase Oklo now but want to buy into the next-generation nuclear energy industry and its AI-boosted home run upside should look no further than Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Rolls-RoyceRYCEY. Rolls-Royce provides investors with the stability of a diversified industrial giant, mixed with the blockbuster potential of next-gen nuclear. It is utilizing its decades of expertise in nuclear propulsion systems for submarines to build cutting-edge small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). RYCEY stock skyrocketed 1,700% in the past three years as Wall Street fell in love with the once-beaten-down industrial titan because its new CEO, who officially took over in January 2023, is focused on profits, streamlined growth, and the future. Rolls-Royce reached several of its lofty financial goals faster than it originally anticipated, and it reinstated its dividend earlier this year and announced buybacks. Despite its climb, RYCEY trades 23% below its average Zacks price target at around $15.70 a share, and it looks ready for a potential breakout. Oklo trades at around $130 per share, which might make RYCEY even more appealing to some investors. There won’t be an AI age unless the U.S. and the world spend trillions of dollars expanding energy generation capacity and the grid, because AI marks a paradigm shift for energy demand. Generative AI platforms like Chat GPT use 10x the energy of an average Google search, while large data centers consume as much electricity as a midsize city. U.S. electricity demand is set to grow by ~75% by 2050. This backdrop is why the U.S. government is aiming to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The U.S. and the UK entered a strategic nuclear energy and AI partnership earlier this week. Furthermore, all of AI hyperscalers from Amazon to Meta have made blockbuster nuclear power deals and are actively supporting SMR development. In short, nuclear energy has the potential to power the AI arms race and the broader economy. The historic engine maker is as close to a surefire winner as there can be in the next-gen small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) space. The London-based company landed a potentially game-changing nuclear energy deal with the British government in June to build SMRs, beating out several others for the first-of-its-kind contract. Rolls-Royce is also crucially a multinational aerospace and defense powerhouse. It is not a pure-play speculative bet on SMRs that haven’t even been built. It’s not a stretch to say that investors should have a bit more confidence that Rolls-Royce, which has built cutting-edge aircraft engines and nuclear propulsion systems for submarines for decades, is more likely to be a winner in next-gen nuclear power than some of its pre-revenue upstart competitors. Rolls-Royce is working with Great British Nuclear to build its first three small modular reactors by the 2030s, with £2.5bn of funding pledged through 2029 and billions more expected once construction begins. On top of that, Rolls-Royce SMR was named in late 2024 as the preferred supplier for SMR construction by the Czech Republic. Former oil industry executive Tufan Erginbilgic took over Rolls-Royce in January 2023, with a clear goal of boosting profitability and revamping the entire company after a disappointing decade. RYCEY reported blockbuster 2024 results and boosted its guidance, noting it was well ahead of its goal of quadrupling profits by the end of 2028. It also reinstated dividends and announced a £1bn share buyback program. Rolls-Royce is projected to grow its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 50% in FY25 and 17% in FY26 to reach $0.45 a share next year, up from $0.26 in 2024. The company’s earnings outlook has surged over the last few years, helping drive RYCEY’s rally. Its recentpositiveEPS revisions help it earn its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). RYCEY stock has skyrocketed 1,700% in the past three years, including a 120% jump in the trailing 12 months. Despite its market-crushing performance, it still trades roughly 26% below its late 2013/early 2014 highs and 23% below its average Zacks price target at $15.70 a share. The nearby chart shows that it’s on the verge of potentially breaking out above a key range between 2013-2015 that might help it return to its peaks. Rolls-Royce has been on a much steadier charge higher in 2025 than Oklo, which could be reaching a near-term high if the nuclear FOMO traders take profits. On the valuation front, the stock is trading nearly in line with its Aerospace sector at 35.7X forward 12-month. This also marks a 67% discount to Rolls-Royce’s highs, which puts a spotlight on its strong EPS growth outlook. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The microreactor company trying to innovate in nuclear energy technology is rising alongside theentire nuclear sectorin reaction to a proposed sale of one of its reactor designs to a company in the United Kingdom.

Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Nuclear energy stocks have seen a resurgence in 2025. Nano Nuclear shares are up close to 100% year to date, while other stocks -- such asOklo, up 500% -- have performed even better. There has been a lot of news driving these share prices higher. This week, we have two announcements driving Nano Nuclear's share price into the stratosphere, one from the U.S. and U.K. governments and one from the company itself. First, the United States and United Kingdom signed a partnership agreement to spend boatloads of money on new technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and nuclear energy. Even though Nano Nuclear was never mentioned in this announcement, its shares rose on the news. Second, Nano Nuclear signed an agreement with a company in the United Kingdom to sell its ODIN reactor design for a total of $6.2 million. If the technology is ever used, Nano Nuclear will receive low-single-digit royalty payments from the company in a licensing agreement. To be clear, this is a reactor design not currently approved by regulators. Nano Nuclear may earn some one-time revenue from this product announcement, but it is essentially still a prerevenue business. None of its designs have been proven viable or approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It is unclear whether tiny nuclear reactors even make sense economically. And yet Nano Nuclear stock is soaring and is trading close to a $2 billion market capitalization. This is a huge jump for a deal that will bring a one-time payment of $6.2 million. The company will remain unprofitable, having burned $32 million infree cash flowover the last 12 months alone. With no timeline for generating any operating revenue -- let along positive cash flow -- Nano Nuclear is a company investors should avoid adding to their portfolios right now.
