They double down on their negativity. So we watch Oklo up another 29% day, this is one that were up a hundred since I said just go buy it because the government favors nuclear for the umpteenth time. We look at the quantum computing stocks, you know, I think you have to buy those too.” Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced fission power plants to deliver clean and reliable energy. In addition, the company commercializes nuclear fuel recycling technology that transforms waste into usable reactor fuel. Cramer mentioned the stock in the September 18 episode.
