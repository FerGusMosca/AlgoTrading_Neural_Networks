California-based Oklo is one of the fastest-rising names in nuclear. The startup will invest $5 million in Sweden's Blykalla, teaming up on advanced small modular reactors technology seen as quicker and cheaper to deploy. With demand for carbon-free power set to soar, Oklo's market value has already surged over 400% this year. CEO Jacob DeWitte and Jacob Stedman, CEO of Blykalla, joined Bloomberg Open Interest to talk about the partnership.
