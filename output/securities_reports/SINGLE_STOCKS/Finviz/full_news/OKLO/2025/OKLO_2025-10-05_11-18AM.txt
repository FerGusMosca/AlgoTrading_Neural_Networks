New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) is one of thestocks Jim Cramer recently commented on. Cramer weighed in on the stock’s rally and its reversal, as he commented: “OKLO, another nuclear stock that I’ve been recommending. It’s up 518% for the year. When OKLO was in the 30s, I said that one good, one good headline could propel the stock to the stratosphere. Now, it’s in the 130s. Sure enough, we got that whole slew of headlines about a $1.68 billion facility in Tennessee, where Oklo will be recycling nuclear waste and fuel for its advanced reactors. The stock went to a high of 144 today before reversing hard, finishing at 131. I think Oklo is a great concept, and I say concept because it has no revenues, but I think with Oklo, here we go, okay, am I clear? We got good news today, and the stock couldn’t maintain its momentum. That’s a bad sign. The intraday reversal, suboptimal.” Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced fission power plants to deliver scalable clean energy and commercializes nuclear fuel recycling technology that transforms waste into usable reactor fuel. While we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
