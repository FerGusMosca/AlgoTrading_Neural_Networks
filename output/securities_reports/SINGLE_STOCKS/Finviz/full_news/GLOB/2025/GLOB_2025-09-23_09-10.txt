Its customers primarily include large companies across North America, Latin America, and Europe. Shares detracted from performance during the quarter after the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, as revenue growth missed analyst estimates. The revenue shortfall was mainly due to clients delaying discretionary IT and digital transformation projects amid macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly within its North American segment. Management highlighted that the slowdown in non essential corporate spending—especially on projects unrelated to core operations or required digital upgrades—was the primary factor impacting new bookings and revenue growth."
