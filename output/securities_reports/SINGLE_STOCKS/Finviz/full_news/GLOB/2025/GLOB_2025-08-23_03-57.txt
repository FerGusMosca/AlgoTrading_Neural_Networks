New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves On August 14, 2025, Mizuho sharply reduced its price target on Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) from $153 to $91, keeping an ‘Outperform’ rating. This price revision follows the company’s revised 2025 guidance, projecting constant-currency revenue growth between -1% (excluding acquisitions) and +1%, which is down from the prior 2% forecast. Furthermore, the investment firm highlighted Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB)’s longer sales cycles, reduced customer spending, and weaker pipeline conversion across Professional Services, Technology, and Latin America segments. Yet the analyst remains confident in the company’s long-term growth outlook, believing its valuation at roughly 10x 2026 estimated EPS already factors in muted growth expectations. Leveraging its AI-driven platform, Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) delivers digital transformation and technology services globally, serving industries spanning finance, healthcare, entertainment, travel, and education. It is one of the oversold stocks.
