      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves The strategic collaboration agreement (SCA) provides support for global expansion and the development of industry-specific solutions SAN FRANCISCO,Sept. 30, 2025/PRNewswire/ --Globant(NYSE: GLOB), a digitally native company that helps organizations thrive in a digital and AI-powered future, today announced that it has entered into a multi-year strategic collaboration agreement (SCA) with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The agreement extends upon more than a decade of collaboration between Globant and AWS and will enable the companies to provide clients around the world with enhanced support for cloud migrations, generative AI adoption, industry-specific solutions, and more.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves We came across abullish thesison Globant S.A. on Edelweiss Capital Research’s Substack by Javier Pérez. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GLOB. Globant S.A.'s share was trading at $57.49 as of September 22nd. GLOB’s trailing and forward P/E were 23.47 and 9.16, respectively according to Yahoo Finance. Globant has experienced a remarkable journey from its origins as a small Argentine startup in 2003 to a global digital services leader, only to face a sharp decline amid broader industry headwinds. Founded by four friends during Argentina’s economic crisis, the company leveraged local talent to serve international clients, achieving a landmark NYSE IPO in 2014. Its early growth was fueled by marquee clients such as Google, Electronic Arts, and Santander, alongside an innovative operating model built around “Studios” and “Pods,” allowing specialized, agile teams to deliver complex digital solutions. Over the years, Globant expanded into diverse industries finance, media, travel, gaming, and hospitality, offering services ranging from AI and cloud implementation to enterprise platforms and digital marketing, while maintaining a decentralized Argentine workforce and a distinctive corporate culture emphasizing innovation and employee engagement. By 2025, however, the company’s meteoric growth has slowed dramatically, with Q2 revenues up only 4.5% year-on-year and industry-wide pressures, including economic uncertainty and post-pandemic normalization, weighing heavily. Generative AI, while offering efficiency gains through tools like Augmented Coding and AI Pods, poses a dual challenge by potentially reducing demand for human coders and compressing margins. Competition has intensified as peers such as EPAM, Endava, Accenture, and TCS aggressively invest in similar AI capabilities, eroding Globant’s differentiation. High stock-based compensation, once a tool to align employees, now exacerbates dilution amid tight margins, highlighting the tension between growth incentives and shareholder value. Despite these challenges, Globant retains significant capabilities, a diversified client base, and a reputation for delivering high-value digital transformation projects. While short- to medium-term recovery is plausible, sustaining long-term differentiation and navigating AI-driven industry changes remain critical questions for investors assessing the company’s risk-reward profile. Previously we covered abullish thesison Accenture plc (ACN) by Sanjiv in December 2024, which highlighted the company’s scale in consulting and managed services, strong free cash flow, operational efficiency, and leadership in cloud and generative AI adoption. The company's stock price has depreciated approximately by 32.62% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as ACN remains a defensive yet innovative player. Javier Pérez shares a similar perspective but emphasizes Globant’s Argentine origins and AI-driven challenges. Globant S.A. is not on our list of the30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 26 hedge fund portfolios held GLOB at the end of the second quarter which was 31 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of GLOB as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Shares detracted from performance during the quarter after the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, as revenue growth missed analyst estimates. The revenue shortfall was mainly due to clients delaying discretionary IT and digital transformation projects amid macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly within its North American segment.

A copy of the letter can bedownloaded here. The market entered 2025 embracing the new U.S. administration’s pro-growth policies, often overlooking potential tariff and valuation headwinds. International stocks have outperformed U.S. stocks since 2009. Despite the positives, global equities remained vulnerable due to geopolitical tensions and growing uncertainty. The Strategy returned 8.16% gross of fees (7.87% net of fees) in the quarter compared to the MSCI ACW Index’s 11.53% return. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2025. In its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, Polen Global Growth Strategy highlighted stocks such as Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB). Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) is a Luxembourg-based technology services company. The one-month return of Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) was -23.81%, and its shares lost 66.85% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On August 19, 2025, Globant S.A.

(NYSE:GLOB) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: \"We’ve fully exited our position inGlobant S.A.(NYSE:GLOB) following the company’s weaker-than-expected Q1 2025 earnings report and disappointing FY25 revenue guidance. While the company has managed to maintain outsized revenue growth relative to its IT services peers for several quarters, recent guidance projecting low single-digit revenue growth for FY25 brings its outlook roughly in line with the peer group. This outcome speaks to the more protracted IT services spending weakness that may continue, and the potentially more discretionary nature of Globant’s business model (which is heavily consulting-based and less reliant on multi-year outsourcing contracts than many larger competitors). Globant may be worth revisiting at a later date, if and when growth reaccelerates. For now, however, we see better risk / reward opportunities elsewhere.\" Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) is not on our list of30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 31 hedge fund portfolios held Globant S.A.

      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/141821/globant-cant-get-its-groove-back-in-q2",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Globant posted only modest growth in Q2, although it did do a bit better than most investors had expected. Globant reported that its AI pipeline expanded 25% year over year to $3.7 billion, an all-time high. Globant has seen its stock lose a lot of ground so far this year, making it essential that the company get its business back on track as soon as possible. Here's our initial take onGlobant's(NYSE: GLOB)fiscal 2025 second-quarter financial report. Globant's latest report included plenty of aspirations about how the company is looking to the future. But the immediate takeaway from the numbers was that Globant isn't quite there yet. Revenue growth came in at just 4.5% compared to year-ago numbers. Adjusted earnings topped investor expectations by a penny per share, but the $1.53-per-share figure was just 1% higher than in the year-ago period. Margin performance also didn't deliver, with figures flat to lower year over year. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » Nevertheless, Globant's executives tried to play up what the future is likely to bring. Co-founder/CEO Martin Migoya pointed to ongoing generative artificial intelligence (AI) adoption and Globant's strategy to embrace its AI Pods, AI Studios, and Enterprise AI platform as part of what he called the \"golden path\" toward taking advantage of AI. Yet it was clear from Migoya's words that he understands there's a lot more work to do, and it'll take more time for the full impact of generative AI to make it into Globant's financials. To be clear, that opportunity is massive. Globant said its pipeline is at all-time highs at $3.7 billion. That's roughly a year and a half's worth of sales at current run rates, and Migoya seems to believe that number is only going to grow as more customers turn to AI-powered solutions. Nevertheless, investors didn't react favorably to the news. Globant stock was trading down 7% in the first half hour after the quarterly report came out. It was apparent that shareholders didn't really seem too impressed with the sales and earnings numbers and had wanted to see a truly colossal quarter that showed Globant's ability to fully capitalize on gen AI trends. In addition, Globant's guidance for the third quarter didn't show that growth is right around the corner. Projections for $615 million in sales would represent just 0.1% growth year over year. For fiscal 2025, Globant now expects at least $2.445 billion, but that too would be just 1.2% higher than 2024's final figures. What's more important for the long run is that after Globant's most recent quarterly results, investors still seem unconvinced that the company is getting itself back on the growth trajectory it seemed to have back in 2021 when the stock was hitting all-time highs. In particular, 2025 has been a tough year for shareholders, with investors getting an unexpected negative surprise after the company's 2024 fourth-quarter financial report back in February. We still see a possibility that Globant will be able to capture more of the boom from generative AI and digital transformation than it has so far. However, it's clear that many shareholders are losing patience with the company. Globant needs to step up its game even more -- and soon -- in order to prove itself.

This compares to earnings of $1.51 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of +0.66%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this information technology services provider would post earnings of $1.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.5, delivering a surprise of -5.06%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Globant, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry, posted revenues of $614.18 million for the quarter ended June 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.19%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $587.46 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Globant shares have lost about 62.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10%. While Globant has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Globant was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.55 on $621.53 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.14 on $2.47 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Software and Services is currently in the top 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Nebius Group (NBIS), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2025.

The company anticipates that it will continue to report both IFRS and certain non-IFRS financial measures in its financial results, including non-IFRS measures that exclude share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related charges, business optimization costs, and the related effect on income taxes of the pre-tax adjustments. Because the company's non-IFRS financial measures are not calculated according to IFRS, these measures are not comparable to IFRS and may not necessarily be comparable to similarly described non-IFRS measures reported by other companies within the company's industry. Consequently, Globant's non-IFRS financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable IFRS measures, but, rather, should be considered together with its condensed interim consolidated statements of financial position as ofJune 30, 2025andDecember 31, 2024and its condensed interim consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three and six months endedJune 30, 2025and 2024, prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (\"IAS\") 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". Globant is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Non-IFRS Adjusted Profit from Operations Margin or Non-IFRS Adjusted Diluted EPS to the most directly comparable IFRS measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, and the tax effect of non-IFRS adjustments. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on IFRS reported results for the guidance period. In addition to historical information, this release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial and operating performance, including our outlook and guidance, our pipeline, and our strategies, priorities and business plans. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Factors that could impact our actual results include: our ability to maintain current resource utilization rates and productivity levels; our ability to manage attrition and attract and retain highly-skilled IT professionals; our ability to accurately price our client contracts; our ability to achieve our anticipated growth; our ability to effectively manage our rapid growth; our ability to retain our senior management team and other key employees; our ability to continue to innovate and remain at the forefront of emerging technologies and related market trends; our ability to retain our business relationships and client contracts; our ability to manage the impact of global adverse economic conditions; our ability to manage uncertainty concerning the instability in the current economic, political and social environment inLatin America; and other factors discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our most recent Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any other risk factors we include in subsequent reports on Form 6-K.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Investors interested in Internet - Software and Services stocks are likely familiar with Globant (GLOB) and NetEase (NTES). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look. The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits. Globant and NetEase are both sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now. This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years. GLOB currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.97, while NTES has a forward P/E of 15.82. We also note that GLOB has a PEG ratio of 2.49. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NTES currently has a PEG ratio of 4.21. Another notable valuation metric for GLOB is its P/B ratio of 1.65. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NTES has a P/B of 4.2. These are just a few of the metrics contributing to GLOB's Value grade of B and NTES's Value grade of C. Both GLOB and NTES are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that GLOB is the superior value option right now.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Chicago, IL – August 13, 2025 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Globant GLOB and NetEase NTES. Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2701581/globant-netease-driving-software-services-strength The Internet-Software & Services industry is highly correlated to the economy; consequently, estimates initially moved down in anticipation of the negative impact of tariffs, inflation and interest rate decisions that typically increase economic uncertainty. The industry appears to be in enjoying operating leverage, which is improving margins as revenue picked back up in the last quarter, along with capital investments. In this background, companies likeGlobantandNetEaseare standing out for a number of reasons. First, they are global operations with their revenue (and risk) spread out across the world. Second, while not immune to macro concerns, they have developed systems of client retention through subscriptions and platforms. Third, they are both leveraging AI in operations and in Globant's case, also helping customers achieve their AI roadmaps.Being the backbone of the digital economy, it's hard to see this industry doing badly over the long term. The diversity of players in this group leads to some dissonance.Valuations have come down a lot making the industry quite attractive at these levels. The Internet Software & Services industry is a relatively small industry, primarily involved in enabling platforms, networks, solutions and services for online businesses and facilitating customer interactions with the use of Internet-based services. The Zacks Internet – Software & Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #100, which places it in the top 41% of nearly 245 Zacks-classified industries. The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates that the growth prospects are improving. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The aggregate estimate revision trend reflects an improving situation. That is because, despite some ups and downs over the past year, the estimates for both fiscal years 2025 and 2026 are showing a net improvement. The 2025 estimate dropped between January and April before moving up again. The 2026 estimate dipped in May before shooting back up in the following month. Overall, the 2025 estimate is up 7.8% over the past year while the 2026 estimate is up 15.5%. Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture. The Zacks Internet – Software & Services Industry has traded at a premium to both the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector and the S&P 500 since the beginning of 2025. Overall, the industry returned 41.8% over the past year, compared with the broader sector's return of 29% and the S&P 500's 20.3%. On the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, we see that the industry is currently trading at its median level of 22.15X, which is a 2.4% discount to the S&P 500 and a 21.3% discount to the technology sector. Technology stocks usually trade at a higher multiple because investors pay a higher premium for innovation. In this case, it appears that valuations have come down considerably of late, making the industry quite attractive. The industry has traded in the range of 17.47X to 24.19X over the past year, as the chart below shows. Globant S.A.: Globant is a technology services provider with global operations. It provides a broad range of solutions including some combination of software and services spanning digital, enterprise technology, ecommerce, AI and other solutions and services directly, as well as through collaborations with AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Oracle, SalesForce, SAP and ServiceNow technology solutions. Its focus industries include banks, financial services and insurance; consumer, retail and manufacturing; travel and hospitality, professional services; technology and telecommunications; healthcare; and others. Globant is headquartered in Luxembourg. Globant's works with some of the leading brands in the world including American Express, Santander, Google, EA, LinkedIn, Petrobras, Johnson & Johnson, British Airways, Embraer, Royal Caribbean, Ferrari, FIFA, Warner Brothers, Disney, Puma, Adidas, Loreal and many more. It serves its elite client base through domain specific Studio networks. The corporate world is speedily moving from mere digitization to AI adoption and Globant is one of the most comprehensive providers across the spectrum. Its current focus on AI-related opportunities through its industry-specialized AI Studios, powered by AI Pods and the Globant Enterprise AI agentic innovation platform is reaping the desired results. IDC expects that by 2028, generative AI will have reached a five-year CAGR of 73.5% while Gartner expects that nearly half of the $7.4 trillion in IT spending by that year will be on software and services. Clearly, Globant is in the industry sweet spot. The fact that its offerings are delivered through a subscription model is a bonus, because it leads to relatively steady inflows that allow it to bypass, to an extent, the macroeconomic and geopolitical gyrations. Globant has recorded very impressive growth in the last 10 years. While its revenues went from a 28.3% CAGR from 2014 to 2024, customer concentration improved significantly (top ten contributed 44% in 2014 versus 29% in 2024). This was achieved while growing average revenue per client by 23.2% for the top 10 and 23% for the top 20. Clients contributing more than a million dollars jumped from 46 in 2014 to 341 in 2024. It therefore remains on track to achieve its 100-squared strategy, i.e. 100 customer accounts with $100 million plus revenue potential. Management intends to diversify its workforce, grow the sales team and make strategic tuck-in acquisitions as necessary in furtherance of these goals. In the last-reported quarter, Globant missed the Zacks Consensus estimate by 5.7% on revenue that missed by 1.8%. The company grew revenues 7% from the year-ago quarter, but slower spending in lieu of macroeconomic uncertainty weighed on results. In this environment, management focus is on driving margins, cash flow and shareholder returns. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company are down 59.7% over the past year. In the last 30 days, its 2025 estimate has increased by a penny while the 2026 estimate dropped by a like amount. Analysts currently expect earnings to decline 4.1% this year on revenue that's expected to grow 2.4%. In 2026, revenue and earnings are expected to grow a respective 5.9% and 6.7%. NetEase, Inc.: Hangzhou-based NetEase provides online services focusing on diverse content, including games, music, other services and education (dictionary, translation and including a range of smart devices) in China. Its products and services are focused on community, communication and commerce, infusing play with culture, and education with technology. NetEase has one of the largest in-house R&D teams in gaming with a very broad focus across mobile, PC and console channels. This is generating tremendous momentum in its business right now. In the last quarter for instance, itsIdentity V,Where Winds Meet,Marvel Rivalsand several other newly launched titles did very well. The strength in gaming, its largest segment by far, offset softness in other segments where the company is pursuing more profitable business. Fresh content is also driving its international business. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 43.8% over the past year. NetEase's earnings for the March quarter came in 23.5% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate with revenues also beating by 2.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 has increased a couple of cents to $8.53 in the last 30 days while that for 2026 has increased 5 cents to $8.97. Analysts currently expect current year revenue and earnings to grow a respective 8.7% and 20.1%. Estimates for the following year are currently expected to grow 6.1% and 5.2%. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of+48.4%, +50.2%and+56.7%per year.

(GLOB) is slated to report second-quarter 2025resultson Aug. 14, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $613 million, suggesting 4.35% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Management anticipates revenues to be at least $612 million, up 4.2% year over year with no FX impact. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.52 per share, indicating an increase of 0.66% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The company forecasts a non-IFRS adjusted EPS of $1.52. GLOB’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters while matching and missing once each, with the average negative surprise being 0.95%. Shares of the company have lost 59.7% against the ZacksInternet- Software and Services industry’sgrowth of 41.4% in the past year. Secular growth trends in AI-related opportunities and strong business momentum are likely to have contributed to Globant’s performance in the second quarter. In addition, growing demand across segments and geographies might have powered its top-line performance. With a decade of strategic AI investments, it is well-positioned to lead in a market expected to reach $4.3 trillion by 2035. The rise of generative AI highlights the urgency for digital transformation among companies. With expertise in distributed teams, a proven Studio Model and Agile Pods methodology, Globant is poised to help organizations adapt and succeed. By 2028, the generative AI market is forecasted to witness a 73.5% CAGR, while total IT spending is projected to hit $7.4 trillion, with half allocated to software and services. Globant’s AI Studios deliver scalable, industry-specific AI solutions focused on high-impact workflows and business outcomes. Backed by deep technical expertise and enterprise AI platforms, it orchestrates intelligent agents that drive measurable innovation and value. Its subscription model offers AI-powered capacity through dedicated AI Pods, combining autonomous agents with expert oversight for efficient, flexible delivery. However, GLOB is facing a tough macroeconomic environment. Since February, the risk of a U.S. recession has increased. Consumer spending is down, and trade tariffs have created uncertainty for many customers. In the United States, pipeline conversion has slowed, and growth in some Latin American countries has been weaker than expected. As a result, management is taking decisive measures to strengthen its financial position and navigate the current environment effectively. For the remainder of the year, the focus will be on driving growth through strategic investments in AI Industry Studios and 100-squared accounts, while safeguarding margins and cash flow. It continues to optimize its footprint and streamline infrastructure, especially through the integration of recent acquisitions. SG&A investments will be aimed at strengthening sales capabilities and go-to-market strategies, while keeping a lean organizational structure. As of the first quarter, adjusted SG&A was 18.3% of sales. It intends to lower this ratio by year-end as revenue increases. In April 2025, GLOB signed an agreement with Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud. This agreement merges its extensive AI expertise with Google Cloud’s cutting-edge infrastructure and AI tools to foster innovation and tackle some of the urgent challenges businesses encounter today, including data silos, process inefficiencies and scalability barriers. The initiative is poised to deliver tailored solutions for Media & Entertainment, Retail, Healthcare and Finance & Banking, including seamless identity management, GenAI-powered mainframe modernization, AI-driven search and archival management, and intelligent agent workflows. In June 2025, GLOB introduced a groundbreaking approach to IT services with the launch of AI Pods—a first-of-its-kind subscription model for AI-powered services. AI Pods enable access to intelligent solutions for engineering, product definition, design and testing at scale, all under a flexible, token-based subscription system, designed to disrupt traditional IT delivery. In July 2025, Globant upgraded its Enterprise AI platform (GEAI) to support Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol, enhancing interoperability for seamless integration with other frameworks and enabling secure, scalable, collaborative AI development. Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for GLOB this time around. The combination of a positiveEarnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here.

      "title": "Globant (GLOB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth\n\n\n(Zacks)",
      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/132131/globant-glob-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves The market expects Globant (GLOB) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on  higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 14. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. This information technology services provider is expected to post  quarterly earnings of $1.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter  has been revised 0.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). For Globant, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.11%. So, this combination  indicates that Globant will most likely  beat the consensus EPS estimate. While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Globant would post earnings of $1.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.50, delivering a surprise of -5.06%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times. An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Globant appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Power Integrations (POWI) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.35 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.34 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of +2.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of integrated circuits used for power conversion would post earnings of $0.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.31, delivering a surprise of +10.71%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Power Integrations, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductors - Power industry, posted revenues of $115.85 million for the quarter ended June 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.90%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $106.2 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Power Integrations shares have lost about 21.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.1%. While Power Integrations has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Power Integrations was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and the current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.45 on $128.16 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.55 on $476.25 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductors - Power is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Globant (GLOB), another stock in the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2025. The results are expected to be released on August 14. This information technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. Globant's revenues are expected to be $613.01 million, up 4.4% from the year-ago quarter. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This marks a sharp improvement from the year-ago quarter's loss by 31.82%Stem’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 12.34%. Stem’s second-quarter 2025 performance is likely to have been driven by continued momentum in its solar asset performance management software platform, Powertrack. In the first quarter, solar ARR rose 10% sequentially and 24% year over year, supported by strong demand in the commercial and industrial segment. The company continued investing in PowerTrack to expand into utility-scale projects and international markets. With utility-scale bookings nearly tripling year over year in the first quarter, these efforts are expected to have positively impacted second-quarter software revenues.The 27% workforce reduction announced on April 9 is another key factor expected to have impacted second-quarter performance. Stem said that this move would generate $30 million in annual cash savings, including $24 million in 2025. These cuts were positioned as consistent with its software-first strategy and intended to support long-term software revenue growth. The cost savings from this reduction are likely to have begun to take effect during the second quarter.STEM also indicated that profitability would improve quarter by quarter through the year. The improvement is expected to come from two areas from ongoing management of operating expenses, and a change in product mix with a reduced share of OEM hardware and more focus on high-margin software and edge devices. Gross margins in the first quarter were already above the full-year guidance range, suggesting this shift might have continued to benefit the quarter to be reported.However, seasonal trends might have slightly impacted bookings in the second quarter. The company noted that total bookings were lower in the first quarter due to seasonality, and it generally sees higher booking volumes in the second half of the year. While key metrics like Contracted Backlog and CARR increased sequentially in the first quarter due to strong solar bookings, the seasonal pattern might have limited overall revenue growth in the early part of the second quarter. Per the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.STEM currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Investors interested in Internet - Software and Services stocks are likely familiar with Globant (GLOB) and NetEase (NTES). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look. We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits. Both Globant and NetEase have a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in. Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years. GLOB currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.21, while NTES has a forward P/E of 15.47. We also note that GLOB has a PEG ratio of 2.51. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NTES currently has a PEG ratio of 4.11. Another notable valuation metric for GLOB is its P/B ratio of 1.94. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NTES has a P/B of 4.1. These are just a few of the metrics contributing to GLOB's Value grade of B and NTES's Value grade of C. Both GLOB and NTES are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that GLOB is the superior value option right now.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings. We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises. Hunting for 'earnings whispers' or companies poised to beat their quarterly earnings estimates is a somewhat common practice. But that doesn't make it easy. One way that has been proven to work is by using the Zacks Earnings ESP tool. The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb. In fact, when we combined a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. Perhaps most importantly, using these parameters has helped produce 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest. Stocks with a #3 (Hold) ranking, which is most stocks covered at 60%, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. But stocks that fall into the #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) ranking, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market. Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank. Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill.BILL Holdings (BILL)earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.42 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on August 28, 2025. BILL Holdings' Earnings ESP sits at +4.48%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.42 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.4. BILL is also part of a large group of stocks that boast a positive ESP. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. BILL is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look atGlobant (GLOB)as well. Globant, which is readying to report earnings on August 21, 2025, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Its Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.53 a share, and GLOB is 23 days out from its next earnings report. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Globant is $1.52, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +0.33%. Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, BILL and GLOB could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports. Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Globant S.A. GLOB recently joined forces with Suntory Global Spirits, the global leader in premium spirits, to roll out a cutting-edge Commercial Insights Agent. This artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solution is transforming how teams across the beverage giant gather insights, make decisions and execute strategy in real-time, compressing days of analysis into seconds.Traditionally, commercial teams in large organizations have relied on business intelligence (BI) teams to access, interpret and present insights from numerous reports, dashboards and unstructured data, which leads to long wait times and high operational costs. Globant’s Commercial Insights Agent seeks to eliminate these delays. By leveraging generative AI, the AI-powered agent can handle complex business queries across different data formats—structured dashboards, static reports and even unstructured documentation—more quickly. The agent empowers teams, particularly in sales, marketing and product management, to independently explore data and obtain real-time insights without relying on analysts or data science teams. This initiative breaks down silos and removes bottlenecks, accelerating the speed of execution across the enterprise.In addition to simple data retrieval, the agent provides contextual recommendations, backed by a generative AI engine trained on Suntory’s internal data. The system offers tailored responses that account for the specific business context.Suntory Global Spirits plans to use it as a template for other AI-powered use cases, such as brand planning optimization, commercial forecasting and innovation pipeline management. By using a strong GenAI foundation, Suntory is becoming an AI-first company, where all areas from operations to innovation are enhanced through intelligent automation.As companies navigate increasingly complex markets and data environments, those that adopt generative and agentic AI are likely to surpass competitors in agility, responsiveness and insight-driven growth. This trajectory aligns with Globant’s vision of the AI-powered enterprise, where every business process is improved or reimagined by intelligent software agents working seamlessly with human teams. Globant continues to transform businesses with leading-edge technology and AI-powered innovations. In June, the company introduced a groundbreaking approach to IT services with the launch of AI Pods—a first-of-its-kind subscription model for AI-powered services. AI Pods provide access to intelligent solutions for engineering, product definition, design and testing at scale, all under a flexible, token-based subscription system designed to disrupt traditional IT delivery.In the last reported quarter, GLOB achieved 7% year-over-year top-line growth driven by secular trends in AI-related opportunities and strong business momentum. Its goal is a 100-client, client-centric model, a strategic initiative to maximize value from its top 100 clients through cross-industry innovation and subscription services. Ongoing innovations in AI Pods, Enterprise AI Platform and AI Studios are major drivers.Nonetheless, the company is facing a tough macroeconomic environment. Since February, the risk of a U.S. recession has increased. Consumer spending is down, and trade tariffs have created uncertainty for many customers. In the United States, pipeline conversion has slowed and growth in some Latin American countries has been weaker than expected. At present, GLOB carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 3.4% loss over the past four weeks. Red Violet is benefiting from strong customer demand across diversified verticals, increased adoption by medium and large enterprise customers, and investments in proprietary data generation, automation, and AI-driven risk solutions. This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues are expected to be $24.5 million, up 28.5% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements. For Red Violet, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Globant (GLOB) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.53 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -5.06%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this information technology services provider would post earnings of $1.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.75, delivering a surprise of 0.57%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Globant shares have lost about 37.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 0.2%. While Globant has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Globant: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.66 on $639.83 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.80 on $2.61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Software and Services is currently in the bottom 18% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. One other stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Semtech (SMTC), is yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2025. The results are expected to be released on May 27. This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +533.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. Semtech's revenues are expected to be $249.79 million, up 21.2% from the year-ago quarter.

We are a member of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord. While the financial figures included in this press release have been computed in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"), this announcement does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in International Accounting Standards 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\" or a financial statement as defined by International Accounting Standards 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\". The financial information in this press release has not been audited. Globant provides non-IFRS financial measures in addition to reported IFRS results prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in the company's business and uses the non-IFRS financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicated internally and externally, for managing the company's business and evaluating its performance. The company anticipates that it will continue to report both IFRS and certain non-IFRS financial measures in its financial results, including non-IFRS measures that exclude share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related charges, and the related effect on income taxes of the pre-tax adjustments. Because the company's non-IFRS financial measures are not calculated according to IFRS, these measures are not comparable to IFRS and may not necessarily be comparable to similarly described non-IFRS measures reported by other companies within the company's industry. Consequently, Globant's non-IFRS financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable IFRS measures, but, rather, should be considered together with its condensed interim consolidated statements of financial position as ofMarch 31, 2025andDecember 31, 2024and its condensed interim consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three months endedMarch 31, 2025and 2024, prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (\"IAS\") 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". Globant is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking Non-IFRS Adjusted Profit from Operations Margin or Non-IFRS Adjusted Diluted EPS to the most directly comparable IFRS measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges, and the tax effect of non-IFRS adjustments. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on IFRS reported results for the guidance period. In addition to historical information, this release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial and operating performance, including our outlook and guidance, and our strategies, priorities and business plans. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Factors that could impact our actual results include: our ability to maintain current resource utilization rates and productivity levels; our ability to manage attrition and attract and retain highly-skilled IT professionals; our ability to accurately price our client contracts; our ability to achieve our anticipated growth; our ability to effectively manage our rapid growth; our ability to retain our senior management team and other key employees; our ability to continue to innovate and remain at the forefront of emerging technologies and related market trends; our ability to retain our business relationships and client contracts; our ability to manage the impact of global adverse economic conditions; our ability to manage uncertainty concerning the instability in the current economic, political and social environment inLatin America; and other factors discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our most recent Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any other risk factors we include in subsequent reports on Form 6-K.

The IT spending environment in recent years has been challenging, and concerns about discretionary enterprise IT spend cloud the outlook for 2025. Stepping back, we continue to have a positive view on Globant. Amidst today's weak environment, with many of its peers reporting negative year-over-year organic revenue growth, Globant still sees a path to >10% revenue growth.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Marchex (MCHX) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.04 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.02. This compares to loss of $0.02 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -100%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this advertising and marketing company would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.03, delivering a surprise of -50%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Marchex shares have lost about 16% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -0.6%. While Marchex has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Marchex: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.01 on $12.44 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.04 on $50.4 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Services is currently in the top 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Globant (GLOB), another stock in the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2025. The results are expected to be released on May 15. This information technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Globant (GLOB) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. This information technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.87% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). For Globant, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.71%. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Globant will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Globant would post earnings of $1.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.75, delivering a surprise of +0.57%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times. An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Globant doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Tyler Technologies shares have lost about 2.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -10.1%. While Tyler Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Tyler Technologies: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.78 on $584.95 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.02 on $2.32 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Operating results were mixed for Globant’s most recently reported quarter, and guidance for 2025 was softer than expected. While the stock has been volatile, we continue to like the company. Global IT spending has been sluggish in recent quarters, but while spending has been uneven, we’ve been impressed that Globant has grown at a higher rate than industry peers. We recently talked to Globant’s management team, and they suggested some firms may have paused spending temporarily on some IT projects.
