      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Investors inGrupo SupervielleS.A.SUPV need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct. 17, 2025 $22.5 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Grupo Supervielle shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Grupo Supervielle is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Banks – Foreign industry that ranks in the Top 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 31 cents per share to 3 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Grupo Supervielle right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks. Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits. Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today. One company value investors might notice is Grupo Supervielle (SUPV). SUPV is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 6.8 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 9.98. Over the past 52 weeks, SUPV's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.16 and as low as 5.93, with a median of 8.40. Investors should also recognize that SUPV has a P/B ratio of 1.05. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.22. Over the past year, SUPV's P/B has been as high as 1.93 and as low as 0.69, with a median of 1.29. Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a preferred metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. SUPV has a P/S ratio of 0.59. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.73. Finally, investors will want to recognize that SUPV has a P/CF ratio of 6.69. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. SUPV's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 16.69. SUPV's P/CF has been as high as 11.41 and as low as 1.38, with a median of 6.89, all within the past year. Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Grupo Supervielle is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, SUPV sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Investors with an interest in Banks - Foreign stocks have likely encountered both Grupo Supervielle (SUPV) and United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOVEY). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look. Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits. Grupo Supervielle and United Overseas Bank Ltd. are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that SUPV likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than UOVEY has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors. Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels. Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years. SUPV currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.08, while UOVEY has a forward P/E of 10.36. We also note that SUPV has a PEG ratio of 2.41. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. UOVEY currently has a PEG ratio of 3.15. Another notable valuation metric for SUPV is its P/B ratio of 1.09. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, UOVEY has a P/B of 1.29. These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SUPV's Value grade of A and UOVEY's Value grade of C. SUPV stands above UOVEY thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that SUPV is the superior value option right now.
