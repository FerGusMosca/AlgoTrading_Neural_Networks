      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Wall Street is treating next-generation nuclear energy companies such as Oklo as direct bets on artificial intelligence. The reason is simple: large AI data centers consume as much electricity as a mid-sized city, which is a huge reason why U.S. electricity demand is set to grow ~75% by2050. The desperate need for more power to fuel AI expansion helped Sam Altman-backed nuclear energy upstart OkloOKLOstock soar 500% so far in 2025, despite being pre-revenue. Investors have also sent established energy giants such as GE Vernova, Constellation Energy, and Vistra skyrocketing over the past few years. AI hyperscalers are taking an all-of-the-above approach to energy from nuclear and natural gas to solar, which is great for energy storage companies. Oklo looks a bit overheated after climbing 140% since early July.It’s time to buy other stocks that could be the next home-run AI energy investments with huge near-term and long-term upside. Investors looking for the next Oklo might want to consider Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) energy storage companyMicrovast, which trades for under $5 a share, and speculative microreactor stockNano Nuclear Energy. Nano Nuclear Energy Inc.NNEis developing advanced portable micro nuclear reactors. The speculative pre-revenue nuclear company envisions a future where its microreactors provide energy to AI data centers, cargo ships, Moon bases, and beyond. Nano’s bull case is deepened by its strong balance sheet ($210 million in cash and cash equivalents vs. $5 million in total liabilities). NNE said last quarter that it’s experiencing “growing support and interest from long-term oriented institutional investors.” AI hyperscalers are partnering with nuclear energy companies like Oklo and ConstellationCEGto make sure they’re prepared to power their data centers. Big tech companies might even buy a few small nuclear energy companies like Nano because securing power is the most difficult part of the AI supply chain. Nuclear energy, as Nano pointed out in its Q3 earnings report in August, is also backed by “unprecedented bipartisan legislative and policy support in the U.S. for nuclear energy.” NNE is gaining interest from Wall Street. Zacks has five brokerage recommendations for the stock, up from two in the spring (3 out of 5 are “Strong Buys”). Nano Nuclear announced in late September that it was included in the S&P Global Broad Market Index (BMI), “the world's first float-adjusted global benchmark.” NNE was also added to the S&P Total Market Index (TMI), which “encompasses the entire U.S. equity market.” These inclusions expand NNE’s visibility to a large swath of investors. Nano Nuclear stock lagged some of its home-run nuclear energy peers in 2025, yet it is still up 80% YTD and 760% since its early May 2024 IPO. Yet, Nano has not broken out above its early 2025 highs. The stock is heavily short (~28% of the float), setting up the potential for quick and substantial upside if Wall Street takes some of its Oklo winnings and dives into Nano. The chart above shows the NNE has held its ground at its post IPO highs and its 21-day moving average. It is also far from overheated on the RSI front, proving NanoNuclearbreakout potential in Q4 and beyond once it climbs above its January peaks. MicrovastMVSTdesigns, develops, and manufactures lithium-ion battery solutions. The Texas-based company boasts that its cutting-edge cell technology and its vertical integration capabilities extend from core battery chemistry to modules and packs. Microvast is capitalizing on the long-term momentum of solar energy expansion, which necessitates the massive deployment of energy storage solutions. It also benefits from the broader electrification of vehicles, big and small. U.S. utility-scale battery storage grew ~66% last year, with it set to add another 20 GW of battery storage to the grid in 2025, to reach nearly 50 GW, up from essentially zero before 2020. The battery technology company's huge beat-and-raise second quarter report in early August sent its FY25 consensus estimate 46% higher, with its FY26 estimate up 21%. MVST’s positive bottom-line revisions help it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). MVST is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$0.27 a share last year to +$0.19 a share in FY25 and then grow its earnings per share (EPS) by 53% in 2026. It is projected to grow its revenue by 22% in 2025 and 2026 to reach $563.5 million vs. $108 million in 2020. Microvast stock soared 120% YTD and over 2,220% off its November 2024 lows. Yet it still trades roughly 23% below its average Zacks price target and 80% beneath its 2021 highs. MVST stock is on the verge of breaking out to new 2025 highs and overtaking a potentially key level highlighted above that could help it start marching back up to its all-time highs. Investors might also be attracted to MVST’s status as a cheap stock trading for roughly $4.60 a share. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to data compiled byS&P Global Market Intelligence,Nano Nuclear Energy's(NASDAQ: NNE)share price had eroded by almost 11% week to date as of Thursday night. This, despite the fact that the company was included on several stock indexes managed by a well-known indexer. Before market open that day, Nano announced that its stock is now a component of not one, not two, but three equity indexes managed byS&P Dow Jones Indices. The trio is theS&P Global Broad Marketindex (BMI), theS&P Total Marketindex (TMI), and theSPX Completionindex. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » These, however, are not as closely tracked and have less prominence than other equity gauges in the S&P family (most notably theS&P 500index). At least Nano has plenty of company. In terms of composition, the BMI is certainly sprawling. As of the end of August, it has 14,782 component stocks, which are collectively headquartered in 48 countries around the globe. The other indexes are notably smaller, at 3,360 for S&P Completion and 3,865 for TMI. The two are related -- S&P Completion has the same composition as TMI, except with the stocks also on the S&P 500 index stripped out. Nano's ascensions definitely represent an advancement for the next-generationnuclear company. However, many investors might be thinking they aren'tenoughof an advancement, since in prestige and visibility terms, the trio is under the level of closely monitored mainstays, again like theS&P 500 index. Nevertheless, if it hasn't already been discovered and researched simply by its presence in the currently hot nuclear sector, Nano will soon go under the microscope by a host of index funds. After all, such vehicles are constantly on the hunt for good investments among a relatively limited pool of stocks.

Shares ofNano Nuclear Energy(NASDAQ: NNE)rose as much as 40% this week, according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence. The microreactor company trying to innovate in nuclear energy technology is rising alongside theentire nuclear sectorin reaction to a proposed sale of one of its reactor designs to a company in the United Kingdom. At 2 p.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 19, shares of Nano Nuclear Energy stock were up 39.4% this week. Here's why. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Nuclear energy stocks have seen a resurgence in 2025. Nano Nuclear shares are up close to 100% year to date, while other stocks -- such asOklo, up 500% -- have performed even better. There has been a lot of news driving these share prices higher. This week, we have two announcements driving Nano Nuclear's share price into the stratosphere, one from the U.S. and U.K. governments and one from the company itself. First, the United States and United Kingdom signed a partnership agreement to spend boatloads of money on new technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and nuclear energy. Even though Nano Nuclear was never mentioned in this announcement, its shares rose on the news. Second, Nano Nuclear signed an agreement with a company in the United Kingdom to sell its ODIN reactor design for a total of $6.2 million. If the technology is ever used, Nano Nuclear will receive low-single-digit royalty payments from the company in a licensing agreement. To be clear, this is a reactor design not currently approved by regulators. Nano Nuclear may earn some one-time revenue from this product announcement, but it is essentially still a prerevenue business. None of its designs have been proven viable or approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It is unclear whether tiny nuclear reactors even make sense economically. And yet Nano Nuclear stock is soaring and is trading close to a $2 billion market capitalization. This is a huge jump for a deal that will bring a one-time payment of $6.2 million. The company will remain unprofitable, having burned $32 million infree cash flowover the last 12 months alone. With no timeline for generating any operating revenue -- let along positive cash flow -- Nano Nuclear is a company investors should avoid adding to their portfolios right now.

      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/168758/3-nuclear-energy-stocks-poised-to-benefit-from-a-rate-cut",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves A Federal Reserve committee is due to issue a rate-cut decision Wednesday afternoon. Lower interest rates mean smaller interest costs for companies that need to borrow money. At 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, give or take a few minutes, theFederal Open Market Committeeshould decide on its next round of interest-rate changes. Presumably it will lower its target interest rate from the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, to one of 4% to 4.25% -- a quarter-point cut. Potentially, it could lower the interest rate by twice as much -- 0.5%. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Continue » Either way, and assuming a cut of any size at all, this will be the first interest-rate cut by theFederal Reservein the past nine months, the Fed having last cut rates (also by 0.25%) back on Dec. 18, 2024. Economists seem pretty certaina rate cut of some size is in the offing. According to the latestinflation update here at The Motley Fool, inflation is still running hotter (2.9%) than the Fed's target rate of 2% -- which you might think would give the Fed some pause. That said, the jobs market is showing sufficient signs of weakness that the Fed is getting concerned -- and inclined to roll the dice and risk a bit of extra inflation in hopes of goosing the jobs numbers higher. In July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that only 73,000 net new jobs were created, which was below projections. Then came August's number, which was an objectively horrible 22,000 net new jobs -- less than one-third of what economists had predicted. And all of this came after May and June jobs numbers were revised downward by more than a quarter-million. Sothe jobs marketdoesn't look great, and that means the Fed probablywillcut rates today. Now what does this mean for you, the individual investor? Believe it or not, bad news for the jobs market and worrisome trends in inflation are both generally interpreted asgoodnews for the stock market -- at least when a Fed interest-rate cut is on the table as a possible solution. This is because when the Fed lowers interest rates, it becomes cheaper to borrow, and cheaper to payinterest on debts, which can be a boon for companies not yet earning profits. Which kinds of companies? Well, maybe I'm biased becauseI write a lot about nuclear stocks. But if you ask about companies that might benefit from debt getting a bit cheaper, the first to come tomymind are the handful working to develop a new generation of small modular (and micro) nuclear reactors (SMRs). In order from smallest to largest, these includeNano Nuclear Energy(NASDAQ: NNE),NuScale Power(NYSE: SMR), andOklo(NYSE: OKLO). Investors value these three companies very differently. Nano Nuclear is worth only $1.5 billion in market capitalization, versus NuScale with an implied market cap of $11.1 billion, and Oklo tipping the scales at a weighty $14.1 billion. But in many respects, these three companies look similar. Neither Nano Nuclear nor Oklo has any revenue to speak of. NuScale, which does havesomerevenue (from technology licenses, not from actual sales of either reactors or nuclear energy), still did only $56 million in business over the last 12 months -- enough to value the stock at nearly 200 times sales. Lacking revenue, it stands to reason that all three of thesenuclear energy stocksare also unprofitable. What worries me more than the losses based ongenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), though, is the fact that these companies must continue burning through their cash reserves as they work toward commercializing their technology. Any nuclear stock that runs out of cash before it starts generating positive free cash flow on its own is at risk of needing to sell shares, or take on debt, to raise the cash it needs. I expect NuScale Power to benefit more than the others from a rate cut today. With only $420 million in the bank and an annual cash burn rate of $95 million, NuScale's on course to be the SMR stock that runs out of cash first -- potentially before it reaches profitability in 2030 (according to analysts polled byS&P Global Market Intelligence). In contrast, both Oklo (with $534 million in cash and a burn rate of $53 million per year) and Nano Nuclear (with $210 million and $23 million, respectively) already have enough cash laid up to keep themselves in business for roughly a decade. Relatively speaking, they're both in stronger financial positions than NuScale is -- but for this very reason, I expect NuScale stock to benefit most from today's Fed rate decision.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Sale of the low-pressure coolant ODIN™enables NANO Nuclear to sharpen focus on its portfolio of gas-cooled technologies — KRONOS MMR™, LOKI MMR™, and ZEUS™— and maximize developmental and regulatory efficiencies and long-term commercial advancement. New York, N.Y., Sept.  17, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NNE) (“Nano Nuclear” or the “Company”),a leading advanced nuclear energy and technology company, today announced the signing of a letter of intent for the proposed sale of itsODIN™low-pressure coolant microreactor design and all associated intellectual property to Cambridge Atom Works, a United Kingdom based advanced reactor developer who is already developing ODIN for NANO Nuclear on an outsourced consulting basis. The letter of intent calls for a total purchase price of $6.2 million, with a $250,000 upfront non-refundable down payment to NANO Nuclear and a $5.95 million payment in 2026 as well as future low single-digit royalties payable to NANO Nuclear based on net sales if and when ODIN is commercialized. The transaction remains subject to execution of definitive documentation and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. This strategic transaction reflects NANO Nuclear’s positioning and consolidation of its micro reactor portfolio to maximize developmental and regulatory efficiencies and long-term commercial advancement. The sale of ODIN would streamline NANO Nuclear’s product line, enabling it to concentrate resources on its related portfolio of gas-cooled, advanced, highly modular microreactors: theKRONOS MMR™Energy System, LOKI MMR™, and ZEUS™. The sale of ODIN to Cambridge Atom Works, which is led by University of Cambridge nuclear science leaders, also seeks to build on the momentum generated within the industry following the recent agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom to accelerate nuclear power development. The newly announced Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy represents a significant step toward aligning regulatory frameworks and scaling down licensing timelines for next-generation advanced nuclear reactors in both countries. “Following our acquisition of the patented, gas-cooled KRONOS MMR™ and LOKI MMR™micro reactor technologies earlier this year, NANO Nuclear has assumed a leadership role in advancing the next generation of nuclear reactors in the United States,”said Jay Yu, Founder & Chairman of NANO Nuclear.“As our product portfolio expanded, we conducted an internal review to best align with the energy goals and the increasing demand for reliable power in our target markets. While we remain confident in the ODIN design, we concluded that a sale of the low-pressure cooled ODIN to a natural buyer familiar with the technology would allow us to move more efficiently going forward with our gas-cooled reactor portfolio. This strategic sale is designed to allow us to recoup our investment in ODIN to date and creates the potential for our receipt of future royalty revenue, all while enabling us to focus our development efforts on our flagship reactor technology to help ensure timely progress across our key projects. Moreover, this decision also comes at a fitting moment, as the recently announced Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy underscores government support in both the United States and the UK for technologies such as ODIN and the KRONOS MMR. By aligning our portfolio with this momentum, we are positioning NANO Nuclear to benefit from strengthened transatlantic collaboration and policy support.” NANO Nuclear continues to focus on the patentedKRONOS MMR™Energy Systemas its flagship, high technology readiness program. Developed in collaboration with some of the world’s leading institutions, the KRONOS MMR is an advanced stationary micro modular reactor. A single-unit configuration of the KRONOS MMR is designed to deliver up to 45 MWth, while a multi-unit configuration can deliver giga-watt level power while significantly enhancing energy resiliency and economics. NANO Nuclear is currently working with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), through the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC), to license KRONOS MMR within the United States, with site preparation and other activities already moving forward at UIUC. NANO Nuclear is also working on a developmental KRONOS MMR reactor in Ontario, Canada. In addition, NANO Nuclear’s recently acquired engineering and manufacturing facility in Oak Brook, Illinois, strategically situated in the center of North America, positions NANO Nuclear to further its plans for construction, testing, regulatory licensing, and commercial deployment of its technologies across the United States and Canada. Figure 1 - NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. Signs Letter of Intent to Sell its ODIN™Portable Low-Pressure Coolant Microreactor to Cambridge Atom Works Ltd. for $6.2 million plus future royalties. NANO Nuclear highlighted that retaining the LOKI MMR™and ZEUS™microreactors was a strategic decision, as the reactors share most of their underlying features with the flagship KRONOS MMR™Energy System. “Continued development of our KRONOS MMR will have direct benefits for LOKI and ZEUS, providing value and benefit across our portfolio,”saidFlorent Heidet, Ph.D., Chief Technology Officer and Head of Reactor Development of NANO Nuclear. “Together, they form a complementary offering, enabling us to achieve synergistic development, regulatory and ultimately commercial progress. As KRONOS MMR advances through construction and licensing, LOKI and ZEUS directly benefit from the aligned technology, regulatory, and supply chain efficiencies.” “The shared foundation of our reactor portfolio should help us improve performance, manufacturability, and regulatory efficiency, while allowing us to maximize shareholder value and protect against developmental cost overruns,”saidJames Walker, Chief Executive Officer of NANO Nuclear. “We look forward to closing the ODIN sale by the end of 2025, if not sooner.” NANO Nuclear Energy Inc.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Nano NuclearEnergy's (NASDAQ: NNE)stock price pulled back in August, opening a buying opportunity for investors. While thissmall modular reactor companyappears well-positioned to meet increasing demand, its stock price should consider potential hurdles. These include the timeline for operational readiness and reactor size, which are notably smaller than those of their competitors. Referred to as a nano-reactor, the KRONOS system has many advantages, but one glaring disadvantage that may hinder its competitiveness in the market. Nano Nuclear Energy's KRONOS reactor is designed to produce 15 MWe, roughly one-third to one-fifth the size of its small modular reactor competitors, which target the high end of the market. They are doing so to address a broader customer base with increasing energy demands. In this context, Nano Nuclear Energy's success might be limited. Regarding the timeline to operations, the company’s best guess is that it will deploy the first commercial reactors in late 2030 to early 2031, years behind Oklo and NuScale Power, and some analysts think the target is optimistic. At least two potential catalysts for Nano Nuclear Energy's stock price include recent changes to government regulation and defense applications. The ADVANCE ACT, passed in 2024, and a series of Trump administration executive orders are clearing the path to faster deployment. The legislation aims to remove red tape, accelerate approval processes, and streamline industry operations. The assumption is that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other relevant bodies will reveal updated processes, catalyzing a reset of market expectations. While Nano Nuclear Energy's reactor size couldlimit its applicationin industrial and data-center settings, it is incredibly useful for numerous niche markets, including defense. The reactors are designed for highway delivery and on-site set-up, requiring no infrastructure or grid connection to operate. This makes them incredibly deployable indefense and remoteapplications where a reliable, steady power supply is needed. Theanalysts' datareported by MarketBeat is bullish, with fiverating the stock as a Moderate Buyand the consensus price target forecasting a 30% upside in late August. The bad news is that recent activity includes a double-downgrade to Sell from Buy from Ladenburg Thalmann, which cited numerous risks. Among them are increasing costs and dilution, which are already substantial. Their price target is only $9, a 70% downside that would align the market with the late-2024 lows. The critical takeaways are that sentiment is slipping and the price target is falling,factors that can cap gainsin this market for the foreseeable future. Nano Nuclear Energy has a healthy balance but is virtually guaranteed toneed to raise additional capital. The highlights at the end of FQ3 2025 reveal increased cash, assets, and equity, but nearly 100% of the gain is cash, and existingshareholders are footing the bill. The money, generated from debt and stock offerings, topped $209 million but is barely sufficient to cover eight quarters of operations at the Q3 burn pace. Even if the company extends it to 16 quarters, the sum is still insufficient; this company will run out of money before 2030. Until then, shareholders have to contend with the 40% increase in year-over-year share count and a filing for a security offering that paves the path for additional dilution. The institutional trends are bullish for this stock, but providetepid supportfor this market. The group owns about 55% of the stock and has been buying on balance all year, but selling started to pick up in August, and short interest is troubling. Short interest increased over the preceding few months to hit record levels in August. At 23%, it is sufficient to cap gains in this market. The risk now is that support at the 150-day moving average will fail, and new lows will be set. In this scenario, this market could fall as profoundly as the $24 to $20 range.

Its products make the firm one of the most speculative nuclear power stocks. NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NNE)’s shares have gained 31% year-to-date and 89% since Cramer commented on the firm in October. One major catalyst for the stock came in May after President Trump signed an executive order to boost the small nuclear reactor industry in the US. Cramer commented on the firm’s financials, and his worries aren’t unwarranted as NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NNE) posted a net loss of $10.1 million during its fiscal year ending in September 2024 on the back of no revenue: Cramer’s more recent comments about NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NNE) have advised viewers to sell the stock: “I think you just sell Nano Energy.

The bearish outlook that Ladenburg shared on Monday for thenuclear energy stockhad a significant effect on investors, who continued to sell shares through Wednesday. But Thursday brought a reprieve to the sell-off. Nano Nuclear Energy reported that the company had advanced to the final round of the pitch event for the U.S. Army xTechSearch 9 competition. The is a competitive initiative led by the U.S. Army's xTech program that fosters engagement with sophisticated technology companies to explore solutions for critical defense applications.

      "link": "https://finviz.com/news/145288/who-won-and-who-lost-in-nuclear-energys-q2-earnings",
      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves In 2025,stocks involved in nuclear energyhave been some of the best performers in the market. Established leaderConstellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG)is up 44%, and small modular reactor developerNuScale Power (NYSE: SMR)is up 95% as of the Aug. 18 close. The favorable stance on nuclear energy from artificial intelligence (AI) hyperscalers and the Trump administration has been a big component of these rallies. However, when it came to Q2 earnings, the market reaction for nuclear stocks wasn’t always a positive one. Below, we'll look at some of the most talked-about names in this space and detail who won and who lost on Q2 earnings. All data is as of the Aug. 18 close unless otherwise indicated. As the largest operator of nuclear energy plants in the United States,Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG)is one name that cannot go undiscussed. In Q2, this industry leader posted results that beat Wall Street expectations. Revenue came in$1.2 billion higher than expected, and adjusted earnings per share beat by 9 cents. Still, these results didn’t elicit much of a reaction from markets. Shares were down slightly in the trading session after the Aug. 7 report, and are down around 5% overall since reporting. This is likely because the company did not change its guidance despite these significant beats. However, what puts Constellation in the winners category in Q2 is the highly positive reactions from Wall Street analysts. KeyCorp, Raymond James Financial, and BMO Capital Markets have allincreased their price targets for Constellation. Argus has also established a target price. The MarketBeat consensus price target on Constellation is approximately $321, implying shares are fairly valued. However, the updated price targets from the four analysts above paint amuch more bullish picture. The average target among those analysts is approximately $375, implying that shares could rise by almost 17%. For a stock up 44% in 2025, this is a welcome indication that Constellation's big-time rally could continue. Small modular reactor (SMR) developer NuScale Power’s Q2 earnings didn’t inspire markets. The firm’s revenue was just over $8 million, around$2.4 million lower than anticipated. NuScale also posted a larger-than-expected loss. Shares fell 12% the day after the Aug. 7 report and have been down more than 20% overall since the reporting. Still, being overly critical of the firm’s misses is hard. NuScale doesn’t provide revenue guidance, making it difficult for analysts to predict the company’s quarterly financials. On the positive side, NuScale announced that it received U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Standard Design Approval for its uprated 77 MWe design ahead of schedule. This may be why UBS Group and Canaccord Genuity Group analystsraised their price targeton NuScale despite the missed earnings. Given these positive and negative indicators, putting the company’s Q2 in the neutral category is fair. However, the company’s Q2 loss per share was significantly better than expected, helping shares rise 2% on Aug. 15. However, on Aug. 18, shares dropped by nearly 11% due to a scathing update from Ladenburg Thalmann. Still, HC Wainwright left its price target unchanged at $50. Overall, Nano saw one of the few analysts covering the stock move from being bullish to being bearish. While it is only one opinion, andHC Wainwright remains bullish, this makes Q2 feel like a negative quarter for Nano. Shares surged 9% after the firm’s August 11 release as the company announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) selected it for three reactor pilot programs. Overall, Q2 was a generally positive quarter for these nuclear names. None posted an extremely bad report, and most of these names saw their price targets increase. Upgrades going to Constellation stand out, indicating upside for one of the safest stocks in the industry. Oklo’s positive momentum in winning government projects is also an encouraging sign for this pre-revenue player.

With an analyst providing a starkly bearish take on the nuclear energy stock, investors are choosing to click the sell button today. As of 10:24 a.m. ET, shares of Nano Nuclear Energy are down 7.7%, paring back an earlier loss of 12.1%. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » Downgrading Nano Nuclear Energy stock to a sell from a buy, Ladenburg analyst Michael Legg foresees shares sliding considerably. Legg also downwardly revised his price target on Nano Nuclear Energy stock to $9 from $51. Based on the stock's closing price of $35.89, Legg's new price target implies downside of 74.9% -- that's a lot of downside. According to The Fly, Legg predicated the new take on Nano Nuclear Energy stock after the company's recent third-quarter 2025 financial results and on the belief that management \"promoting a broad, diversified model\" will be less fruitful than if the company emphasized \"core initiatives, particularly the Kronos reactor. In Q3 2025, for example, the company signed amemorandum of understandingwith UrAmerica to help shore up various resources and develop its vertically integrated capabilities. While the negative commentary from Ladenburg is surely disheartening for Nano Nuclear Energy investors, this is merely one analyst's opinion. A tide of similar bearish commentary hasn't surfaced among analysts, so the perception that Nano Nuclear Energy is moving in a less-productive direction should be taken with a grain of salt. Similarly, other analysts haven't echoed the drastic price target revision -- let alone the fact that analysts'price targetsare often limited to a shorter investing horizon than the long-term holding periods The Motley Fool favors. For current shareholders, Ladenburg's perspective is worth acknowledging, but today's commentary should hardly signal that now's the time to jump ship.

(NASDAQ: NNE) (“NANO Nuclear” or “the Company”), a leading advanced nuclear energy and technology company focused on developing clean energy solutions, today reported its third fiscal quarter financial results and provided a business update. “NANO Nuclear continues to benefit from a global nuclear energy renaissance driven by several long term, sustainable growth trends and significant regulatory tailwinds. These include growth in AI data centers, industrial reshoring, and broader electrification, all driving a significant need for clean and reliable power, energy sustainability and independence, and climate mandates requiring reliable zero-emissions energy, all coming in an era of unprecedented bipartisan legislative and policy support in the U.S. for nuclear energy. Equally important, there is broad recognition that advanced reactors like the ones we are developing will be critical to future clean energy infrastructure,”said Jay Yu, Founder and Chairman of NANO Nuclear. “As we look at our competitive position in the advanced nuclear reactor space, our January 2025 acquisition of the KRONOS MMRTMEnergy System has accelerated our trajectory, positioning us as a North American leader in the race to microreactor commercialization. During the quarter, our team continued to build onto a strong start to the year, achieving several critical milestones tied to the advancement of KRONOS MMR toward construction, demonstration, licensing and deployment in the U.S. and resuming the efforts of KRONOS’ prior owner in Canada. We’re confident KRONOS’ proven high- temperature gas reactor design, significant prior R&D investment, and numerous patents validate its high-technological readiness and differentiate it from our competition. With a strong balance sheet, access to capital, and growing support and interest from long-term oriented institutional investors, we believe we’re well-positioned to capitalize on the broader macro trends driving demand for our advanced nuclear solutions.” Advancing KRONOS MMR Toward Licensing and Deployment in U.S. and Resuming Canadian Demonstration Site Key Appointments & Wins Validate Growing Significance in Advanced Nuclear Industry​ Recruitment Drive, Engineering New Hires, and Acquisition of Demonstration and Office Facility to Support KRONOS MMR Development Selected for Inclusion into Solactive Global Uranium & Nuclear Components Total Return Index, Qualifying It for Inclusion in the Prominent Global X Uranium ETF (“URA”) Advancing Proprietary Annular Linear Induction Pump (ALIP) Technology Through SBIR Phase III Program KRONOS MMR Well-Positioned to be a North American Leader in the Microreactor Race Expect Strong Financial Profile and Access to Capital to Enhance Competitive Positioning “Our team is making significant progress across several key initiatives and is dedicated to advancing and executing our technology development roadmap,”said James Walker, Chief Executive Officer of NANO Nuclear.“With the potential of being the first commercial microreactor in the U.S. to successfully file for a construction permit application and the first licensed microreactor in Canada intended for commercial deployment, the KRONOS MMR positions us as a leader in the North American microreactor race. Our growing significance in the advanced nuclear energy industry, compelling technology, bold vision and laser focused efforts are enabling us to expand both our technical and regulatory teams to propel our strategic initiatives. Ensuring the successful deployment of KRONOS MMR requires more than just reactor design, which is why we have made it a priority to focus on securing key stages of the nuclear fuel supply chain. We also believe this commercially focused, vertically integrated approach gives us leverage to capture upside across multiple verticals as the broader advanced reactor market grows. Looking ahead, with a strong balance sheet, clear access to capital, and a world class technical and leadership team filled with former U.S. national leaders, we believe we’re well-positioned to deploy our microreactors and capture value across the broader nuclear energy landscape.” NANO Nuclear Energy Inc.

Shares ofOklo(NYSE: OKLO), one of a handful of start-upnuclear power companiesaiming to commercialize small modular reactors, jumped more than 6% in early trading Wednesday before reversing course and losing it all. As of 12:35 p.m. ET, Oklo stock is now down 1%. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) picked Oklo to perform two projects under its new Reactor Pilot Program, and picked Oklo subsidiary Atomic Alchemy to perform a third, the company announced today. All three projects are in furtherance of President Donald Trump's May 2025 executive order to get at least three working small modular reactors (SMRs) up and running by July 4, 2026. This sounds like pretty great news for Oklo, and we haven't heard (yet) about either of its closest rivals in the SMR space,Nano Nuclear Energy(NASDAQ: NNE)orNuScale Power(NYSE: SMR), winning similar contracts. Both of those other nuclear stocks are down today, by the way, and down even more than Oklo. Digging a little deeper into the news, however, and going to DOE's website to learn if any other companiesdidwin contracts, I discovered that a total of 10 separate companies (two of which are Oklo or its subsidiary) did win contracts. Neither of the 10 is Nano Nuclear or NuScale, which is pretty bad news for those companies, I suspect. But also, eight of them arenotOklo, and that means Oklo's not quite the odds-on favorite to inaugurate the nation's nuclear renaissance, as its initial press release might lead one to believe.

(NASDAQ: NNE) (“NANO Nuclear” or “the Company”), a leading advanced nuclear energy and technology company focused on developing clean energy solutions, today announced that its proprietary, patent pending Annular Linear Induction Pump (ALIP) technology for nuclear reactors has been assembled onto a test loop and integrated to a controllable test setup for variable design validation at NANO Nuclear’s Demonstration Facility in Westchester County, New York. As NANO Nuclear continues progress with its microreactor programs, including its leadKRONOS MMRTMEnergy Systemproject, the ALIP assembly milestone demonstrates NANO Nuclear’s leadership in advanced nuclear energy technology and its ability to move technology from initial design to construction and demonstration. NANO Nuclear hopes to be able to start commercial sales activities for ALIP by the end of this year or next year. This milestone also underscores the utility of NANO Nuclear’s Westchester Demonstration Facility, which became operational earlier this year. “This initial milestone with ALIP shows in a small but very promising way what we can do as a company in the real world,”said James Walker, Chief Executive Officer of NANO Nuclear. “ALIP is an enabling technology that supports the development of next-generation reactors utilizing molten salts or liquid metals, and advancing ALIP through the SBIR Phase III process has allowed us to mature the system extensively, refining its design, validating key performance metrics, and preparing it for integration into demonstration-scale platforms at our custom-built Westchester facility. This progress not only enhances the technology’s readiness for deployment but also opens a clear pathway toward revenue generating activities for NANO Nuclear as we progress work on our broader portfolio of advanced nuclear technologies.” The ALIP technology is a thermal management and distribution system within NANO Nuclear’s suite of advanced nuclear energy technologies. It operates using electromagnetic, in place of mechanical, pumps and could serve as a critical component in the development of advanced molten-salt and liquid-metal nuclear reactors. As previously announced, earlier this year, NANO Nuclear collaborated with aRobotics Company, a leading innovator in robotics fabrication, inspection, engineering and testing, to support NANO Nuclear’s ongoing SBIR Phase III program for ALIP, which was previously funded by the U.S Department of Energy. Data from the test and validation work being done will be leveraged to support the SBIR Phase III program. Figure 1 - NANO Nuclear Energy ‘s ALIP Technology (center) integrated on the Test Loop inside Custom-Engineered Thermal Chamber at the Demonstration Facility in Westchester County, New York. “Developing the first iteration of NANO Nuclear’s ALIP and its adjacent test instrumentation enables us to collect crucial data and advance this project towards its ultimate goal of commercialization,”said Jay Yu, Founder and Chairman of NANO Nuclear“With the support of aRobotics Company, we plan to steadily develop and test additional generations of ALIP as we improve the technology’s readiness for the market.” Figure 2 - ALIP’s Integrated Data Acquisition System & Control Panel (ALIP pump seen at left of image) \"We believe ALIP will have a number of applications upon development including in the space and defense sectors,”said Akaash Kancharla, CEO of aRobotics Company.“The procedural knowledge and material science advanced by this work will have implications far beyond this useful product.” By utilizing a time-varying magnetic field, ALIPs enable the movement of conductive fluids without mechanical components, reducing wear and maintenance requirements while increasing efficiency. Current efforts at the NANO Nuclear Demonstration Facility are geared towards the development of the first operational ALIP prototype and a custom designed test loop for research data collection, alongside a magnetic field mapping system, for the collection of manufacturing and performance data. Future work will include testing and characterizing pump performance with different working fluids, simulating component failure scenarios, and material testing.

Fluor also generates substantial free cash flow, and is valued attractively relative to both forward earnings and current free cash flow. President Donald Trump says he wants the U.S. to quadruple its nuclear power output by 2050, from 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts. In May, he signedfour executive ordersaimed at accelerating the development of new nuclear power plants in the United States. Among other things, those orders direct: If all of this makes you think that now might be a good time to invest innuclear power stocks, well, you're not alone. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocksto buy right now.Learn More » Three start-up nuclear companies developing \"micro\" and somewhat larger \"small\" modular nuclear reactors --Nano Nuclear Energy(NASDAQ: NNE),NuScale Power(NYSE: SMR), andOklo(NYSE: OKLO)-- have all outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year. Nano's outperformance is currently the smallest, but NuScale for example is up 160% in 52 weeks, and Oklo's stock is up more than 620%. By comparison, nuclear power plant builderFluor(NYSE: FLR)stock's performance has been relatively tame. Up 19% over the past year, it has also outperformed the S&P 500. But if you ask me, Fluor stock should actually be doing much better than these smaller companies, because its valuation is so much cheaper ... especially relative to its earnings. If you've got $1,000 or so lying around, and have been wanting to put it to work in a nuclear stock, Fluor just might be the one you've been waiting for. Last week, I went so far as to call Fluor \"the smartest nuclear stock\" money could buy. I came to this conclusion based on the fact that Fluor owns a majority interest in small modular reactor builder NuScale, yet has a smaller market capitalization than NuScale's $10.3 billion implied market cap (according to the latest data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence), as well ass Fluor's track record of being profitable for the past three years. Contrast that with NuScale, Oklo, and Nano Nuclear, all of which remain unprofitable. The consensus view among analysts covering Fluor is that it will earn $470 million in 2026, nearly $530 million in 2027, and $638 million in 2028. Its 2024 and projected 2025 earnings are abnormally much higher and much lower, respectively, than these numbers. But assuming analysts are correct that Fluor's earnings volatility will finally settle down starting next year, $470 million in earnings on an $8.7 billion market cap values Fluor stock at only 18.5 times forward earnings. This seems a reasonable price to me, given the steady earnings growth analysts are predicting. Speaking of earnings, earnings quality for the company is good, with real free cash flow (FCF) largely backing up the GAAP numbers on Fluor's income statement. Analysts forecast it will generate positive free cash flow of $343 million already this year, making theprice-to-free-cash-flow ratio25. Back out the net cash on its balance sheet, and Fluor's enterprise-value-to-FCF ratio drops to just 21. Analysts expect its FCF to grow by more than 20% annually for at least the next three years, to $598 million by 2028. That puts it very close to an EV/FCF/growth ratio of 1.0, which would qualify Fluor stock asa value stock. And if you further subtract out the value of Fluor's NuScale stake, I'd argue that it's cheap enough to make the company more like a deep value stock. When compared to most nuclear companies that aren't earning any profits at all, this cheap valuation makes Fluor not only one of the best ways to play the nuclear power renaissance, but a just plain cheap stock to invest in, period.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves President Trump's executive orders in May was one factor motivating investors to buy Nano Nuclear stock in June. The company isn't likely to generate revenue anytime soon, so conservative investors may be more comfortable with a nuclear energy ETF. While not the same as the 32.4% gain it logged in May, the rise inNano NuclearEnergy(NASDAQ: NNE)stock last month was undoubtedly well received among investors. According to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence, Nano Nuclear Energy stock shot 14.5% higher in June. President Trump's clear support for thenuclear energy industryhelped earlier in the month to buoy the company that's developing micro-small modular reactors (SMRs), while momentum toward the passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill provided incentive for investors to click the buy button at the end of June. Nano Nuclear began June with the wind at its back, thanks to the executive order that Trump signed in late May meant to spur development of the domestic nuclear energy industry. In addition to advancing the development of next-generation nuclear energy assets that can shore up infrastructure that supportsartificial intelligence(AI) -- such as data centers -- the executive order seeks to remove a lot of the regulatory hurdles that are challenging SMR companies such as Nano Nuclear. As June rolled along, it became increasingly clearer that the Democrats would be unable to thwart the passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill -- legislation that was well received by the nuclear energy industry. Upon the Senate's approval of the legislation, in fact, Maria Korsnick, president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, applauded the bill that \"allows us to continue down the path to achieve the administration's ambitious goals for deploying new, cutting-edge nuclear technologies that will meet the growing demand for more reliable energy.\" Whereas the nuclear power production tax credit was set to expire at the end of 2031, the Senate version of the budget reconciliation bill extends the nuclear power production tax credit through 2032. Plus, the bill extends the tax credits for new nuclear generation through 2033. Although it seems as if the U.S. is one the verge of entering a nuclear energy renaissance, it's important to acknowledge that Nano Nuclear is still far away from bring one of its SMRs to market. Moreover, it's unlikely that the company will start generating revenue anytime in the foreseeable future. For the time being, nuclear energy-focused investors would be better advised to consider one of the other leading SMR companies. On the other hand, those who are looking to reduce their exposure to risk would likely be more comfortable with anuclear energy ETF.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves As the global clean energy sector continues to evolve, nuclear energy stocks likeOklo Inc.OKLO andNANO NuclearEnergy Inc.NNE have started gaining attention lately. With rising government support and increased investment in small modular and advanced nuclear technologies, both companies are well-positioned to capitalize on the growth trend of the nuclear energy industry.While Oklo is focused on developing next-generation fission powerhouses and compact fast reactors that can recycle used nuclear fuel, NANO Nuclear is working on microreactors that aim to deliver clean, portable and scalable nuclear power. With the U.S. nuclear capacity boasting the potential to triple by 2050, both OKLO and NNE have strong potential for long-term growth.This leads to a key question for investors: Which of these two stocks is a better choice? Let’s take a closer look. Recent Achievements: In June 2025, Oklo’s subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy, commenced site characterization work at a potential location for a commercial radioisotope production facility in Idaho, at the Idaho National Laboratory .In the same month, Oklo received a Notice of Intent to Award for deploying its Aurora powerhouse at Alaska’s Eielson Air Force Base, marking a key step in the Department of the Air Force’s microreactor pilot program. If finalized, this long-term agreement would allow OKLO to design, build and operate the plant, providing clean power for critical defense infrastructure.In June, it also announced that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission had begun reviewing its Licensed Operator Topical Report, marking progress in OKLO’s regulatory plans towards achieving a license to operate its Aurora powerhouses.Financial Stability: Oklo ended the first quarter of 2025 with $201 million in cash and cash equivalents, including marketable debt securities. The company did not report any notable debt as of March 2025, indicating a solid financial footing. This strong liquidity position should support the continued development of its Aurora powerhouses along with its operational and growth-related activities in the near future.Challenges to Note: A major point of concern for investors is that Oklo is still in the pre-revenue stage, with its first Aurora powerhouse not expected to be operational until 2027. This indicates limited income opportunities in the short term. Additionally, the company continues to incur high operating expenses tied to the development of its reactor technology, which could weigh on its near-term financial performance. Recent Achievements: In June 2025, NANO Nuclear signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Namibia Industrial Development Agency to explore building a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain in Namibia.Moreover, in May, the company filed six new utility patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its ZEUS microreactor. ZEUS is being designed as a solid-core, sealed microreactor that avoids in-core coolant, reducing the risks of coolant-related accidents. These patents show the company’s commitment to innovating compact, safe nuclear technologies.Financial Stability: NANO Nuclear ended the fiscal second quarter of 2025 with $119 million in cash and cash equivalents, including marketable debt securities. The company did not report any notable debt as of March 2025, indicating a solid financial footing. This strong liquidity position should support the continued development of its microreactors along with its operational and growth-related activities in the near future.Challenges to Note: NANO Nuclear remains in the pre-revenue stage, as it continues to focus on research and development of its microreactors. This indicates limited income opportunities in the short term. Additionally, like other nuclear startups, it faces long regulatory timelines and high development costs before commercial operations can begin. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Oklo’s 2025 earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at a loss of 46 cents per share, which implies a solid improvement from the year-ago reported loss of 74 cents per share. The company’s EPS estimates have, however, been trending downward over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NNE’s fiscal 2025 EPS is pegged at a loss of $1.05 per share, which implies a deterioration from the year-ago reported loss of 39 cents per share. The company’s EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 have moved south over the past 60 days, while the estimates for fiscal 2026 have moved north. OKLO shares are expensive compared with NNE, with its trailing 12-month Price/Book (P/B TTM) being 28.72X compared with NNE’s P/B TTM of 10.02X. While both companies operate in promising segments of the nuclear energy space, their pre-revenue status and ongoing operating losses warrant a cautious outlook.Oklo holds a significantly stronger cash position, offering it greater financial flexibility to support ongoing development and future growth. Its recent regulatory progress and government partnerships further strengthen its outlook. On the other hand, NANO Nuclear, while innovative and expanding globally, remains at a much earlier stage with a smaller capital base.Metric-wise, OKLO shows stronger stock momentum and an improving EPS trend, while NNE offers a more attractive valuation. So, OKLO may be favored by investors seeking growth and catalysts, while NNE may appeal to value-oriented investors.Both Oklo and NANO Nuclear currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Not for the first time this year,Nano Nuclear Energy(NASDAQ: NNE)stock was going somewhat nuclear over the past few trading sessions. On news that a Senate committee desires changes in President Trump's \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" that favor the once-struggling industry, interest rose sharply innuclear stocks. Nano was a direct beneficiary of this; according to data compiled byS&P Global Market Intelligence, its share price had ballooned by nearly 25% week to date as of Friday before market open. The bill is an ambitious budget reconciliation proposal that would reshape the federal budget. Early in the week, one new change floated by the Senate Finance Committee was an adjustment of the tax credits the feds provide to energy producers. Some power-generation technologies currently out of favor with the present administration would have their tax credit expiration dates brought forward, while others would be granted extensions. Happily for Nano investors, nuclear energy is in the latter category. The committee is proposing that nuclear's energy production tax credit, currently set to be phased out on Dec. 31, 2032, have a new expiration date of Dec. 31, 2036. The president has been active in his support for nuclear power, which in the recent past was largely shunned. Its reputational decline was due mostly to high-profile accidents such as the Three Mile Island incident in 1979, and the catastrophic 1986 meltdown of the Chernobyl plant located in Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union). Despite its very positive-sounding name, the \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" is controversial and contentious among both legislators and the U.S. public. Given that, it's very possible that it will be hammered out through more compromises -- and these might lead lawmakers to rescind the nuclear tax credit extension idea. Still, the proposal currently on the table at least indicates continued strong, top-level support for nuclear power, and that can only help companies like Nano.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Shares ofNano Nuclear Energy(NASDAQ: NNE)sank 16% this week, according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence. The nuclear energy start-up closed a private placement offering of common stock that will dilute shareholders, leading the stock to fall. Shares of the pre-revenue company are up 26% this year and up 500% since going public around one year ago. Here's why Nano Nuclear Energy stock was sinking this week, and whether the stock is a buy now. Nano Nuclear Energy wants to build -- as the name implies -- tiny and portable micro nuclear reactors. It filed six patents this week related to its proposed Zeus Microreactor, which is still in development from its engineering team. While patents may indicate a positive move for the stock, Nano Nuclear sank this week because of the pricing of its private placement stock offering to professional investors. Nano Nuclear sold shares of its common stock at a price of $27, which is below its current price of $30 and likely built some selling pressure on shares this week. Indeed, $105 million was raised in the offering, which covers many years of its current cash burn of $10.5 million a year. The company needs the cash, because it does not have a working product yet. It is working on a micro reactor that has never been built before, and it is unclear if the technology will work.Shares outstandinghave consistently climbed as Nano Nuclear has been in the public markets because of its capital needs, which will dilute long-term shareholder returns. It is easy to decide whether an investor should buy Nano Nuclear stock. The company does not think it will have a product until 2030 or later -- and that is if it can even get the technology to work. It generates zero revenue today and will burn money for many years into the future. These are not good stocks to invest in. An individual can hope that Nano Nuclear does well and invents a new way of electricity generation to better society. But hope is not an investment strategy. Smart investors will keep Nano Nuclear stock out of their portfolios because of how high risk this investment is. Don't look at the 500% returns and expect the future to look like the past -- this is a science project with a stock price attached to it.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves New York, N.Y., May  30, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NNE) (“NANO Nuclear” or “the Company”), a leading advanced nuclear energy and technology company, today announced that it has filed six new utility patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) related to itsZEUS™microreactor. ZEUS™ is being designed as a solid‑core battery reactor with a fully sealed core that uses a highly conductive moderator matrix to dissipate fission heat. As designed, there is no fluid inside the core, which lowers the risk typically associated in‑core coolant accident scenarios. Figure 1 – Rendering of NANO Nuclear Energy’s ZEUS™ Advanced Portable Nuclear Microreactor The ZEUS™ design calls for all reactor and support systems to fit within a standard shipping container, creating the potential for exceptional transportability to sites lacking conventional energy infrastructure. The unit is also designed to deliver thermal energy directly for heat applications or convert it to electricity, making it adaptable for a wide range of needs, including district heating, power generation and non‑electric uses such as hydrogen production. “These patent applications for ZEUS reaffirm our commitment to strengthening NANO Nuclear’s intellectual property portfolio,”said Prof. Massimiliano Fratoni, Senior Director and Head of Reactor Design of NANO Nuclear.“The applications are directed towards safeguarding ZEUS’s key processes and components, which would not only benefit our own program but also contribute to progress across the entire advanced nuclear reactor industry.” “We’re pleased to file these new patent applications, which reflect the hard and excellent work of our engineering and technical teams to advance our goal of bringing next‑generation microreactors, like ZEUS™, from development to commercialization,”said James Walker, Chief Executive Officer of NANO Nuclear.” NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NNE)is an advanced technology-driven nuclear energy company seeking to become a commercially focused, diversified, and vertically integrated company across five business lines: (i) cutting edge portable and other microreactor technologies, (ii) nuclear fuel fabrication, (iii) nuclear fuel transportation, (iv) nuclear applications for space and (v) nuclear industry consulting services. NANO Nuclear believes it is the first portable nuclear microreactor company to be listed publicly in the U.S. Led by a world-class nuclear engineering team, NANO Nuclear’s reactor products in development include patentedKRONOS MMR™ Energy System, a stationary high-temperature gas-cooled reactor that is in construction permit pre-application engagement U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in collaboration with University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U. of I.), “ZEUS”, a solid core battery reactor, and “ODIN”, a low-pressure coolant reactor, and the space focused, portableLOKI MMR™, each representing advanced developments in clean energy solutions that are portable, on-demand capable, advanced nuclear microreactors. Advanced Fuel Transportation Inc. (AFT), a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is led by former executives from the largest transportation company in the world aiming to build a North American transportation company that will provide commercial quantities of HALEU fuel to small modular reactors, microreactor companies, national laboratories, military, and DOE programs. Through NANO Nuclear, AFT is the exclusive licensee of a patented high-capacity HALEU fuel transportation basket developed by three major U.S. national nuclear laboratories and funded by the Department of Energy. Assuming development and commercialization, AFT is expected to form part of the only vertically integrated nuclear fuel business of its kind in North America. HALEU Energy Fuel Inc. (HEF), a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is focusing on the future development of a domestic source for a High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel fabrication pipeline for NANO Nuclear’s own microreactors as well as the broader advanced nuclear reactor industry. NANO Nuclear Space Inc. (NNS), a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is exploring the potential commercial applications of NANO Nuclear’s developing micronuclear reactor technology in space. NNS is focusing on applications such as theLOKI MMR™system and other power systems for extraterrestrial projects and human sustaining environments, and potentially propulsion technology for long haul space missions.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Reuters has reported that President Trump is planning to sign an executive order to speed up the permitting and construction of nuclear energy power plants in the U.S. as early as today. The market didn't ask questions and simply bid upnuclear stockstoday. As a result, anything related to nuclear energy was up big, withOklo(NYSE: OKLO)up as much as 31.3%,Centrus Energy(NYSEMKT: LEU)up 26.5%,NanoNuclear Energy(NASDAQ: NNE)jumped 29.7%,NuScale Power(NYSE: SMR)was up 18.3%,Energy Fuels(NYSEMKT: UUU)rose 19.1%, andUranium Energy(NYSEMKT: UEC)popped 26%. As of this writing, at 1:30 p.m. ET, there's no executive order signed, and the most we have is reporting from Reuters. It says the order would invoke the Defense Production Act and direct the Departments of Energy and Defense to speed up the construction of new nuclear reactors. The reporting indicates that reliance on Russia and China for enriched uranium is the basis for the order, with the administration hoping to push development on both private and public land. As with most executive orders, the impact may not be as big as investors might think. It will still take many years to permit and build nuclear power plants, and it's not clear if they would be cost-effective today anyway. So, the sentiment may be correct by the administration, but the financial impact for these companies may disappoint. The bounce is almost entirely built on speculation because most of these companies are either very low revenue or pre-revenue. They're developing technology or solutions for the industry, but that hasn't even manifested in paying customers to this point. As investors, that's a big risk to take for an industry that moves in decades, not months or years. The Obama administration tried to rejuvenate the nuclear industry over a decade ago, and that didn't work, so it's not clear why this would be different. This isn't the first time the nuclear industry has gone through hype cycles. You can see in the chart that long public stocks like Energy Fuels and Uranium Energy have been extremely volatile for two decades. But over that time, they haven't generated meaningful or sustainable earnings that investors can count on. I don't see any reason to think that's going to change this time around. Changes to the nuclear bureaucracy could take years, and by then, there may be a new administration. Financing and constructing nuclear power plants is also not a straightforward endeavor for utilities that may want to invest in the industry, given the high cost and uncertain payback period for projects. I think today's bounce will be another short-term move that will ultimately fall back to Earth as the nuclear industry fails to live up to the hype in the market today. An executive order doesn't change the challenge the industry has building projects economically, and until that changes, it's an area I'll stay out of.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look atNano Nuclear Energy Inc. (NNE), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nano Nuclear Energy Inc. Currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period. In order to see if NNE is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this company holds up. Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area. For NNE, shares are up 13.26% over the past week while the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry is up 3.21% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 35.02% compares favorably with the industry's 6.76% performance as well. Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Nano Nuclear Energy Inc. Have increased 1.61% over the past quarter, and have gained 571.24% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -2.63% and 13.25%, respectively. Investors should also pay attention to NNE's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. NNE is currently averaging 1,813,568 shares for the last 20 days. The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with NNE. Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NNE's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.92 to -$0.58 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period. Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NNE is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Nano Nuclear Energy Inc. On your short list.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on NNE. NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NNE)'s share was trading at $26.07 as of May 15th. NNE is an ambitious vertically integrated developer in the advanced nuclear sector, aiming to become a full-stack provider of micronuclear solutions. The company is building a differentiated platform by combining microreactor design and manufacturing with in-house nuclear fuel processing, logistics, and regulatory consulting. Its four proprietary microreactor models—Zeus, Odin, Kronos mmr, and Loki mmr—target specialized applications, from mobile military use to stationary industrial power and even extraterrestrial deployment. This vertical integration across the nuclear value chain establishes a significant competitive moat and positions NNE as a category leader in the emerging microreactor space. The company is led by CEO James Walker, formerly of Rolls Royce’s nuclear division, and supported by a top-tier team of physicists and executives from leading academic and government institutions, including Oak Ridge and the NRC. NNE operates at the intersection of key secular trends: rising AI-driven power consumption, increasing emphasis on U.S. energy independence, and global decarbonization efforts. With tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon investing in small modular reactors for datacenter use, and U.S. government support through programs like the DOE’s $3.4 billion LEU Acquisition initiative, the market tailwinds are substantial. NNE also holds a strategic advantage through its partnership with LIS Technologies, the only U.S.-based laser uranium enrichment firm. Despite these advantages, the company remains pre-revenue, reporting a $3.1 million loss last quarter and undergoing nearly 20% share dilution to support ongoing development. While the company has $123 million in cash and minimal debt, execution risk remains high. For investors with a long-term horizon and appetite for risk, NNE offers upside in a potentially transformational market. NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NNE) is not on our list of the30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 10 hedge fund portfolios held NNE at the end of the fourth quarter which was 0 in the previous quarter.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves New York, N.Y., May  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NNE) (“NANO Nuclear” or the “Company”), a leading advanced nuclear technology and energy company, today announced the launch of a major irradiation testing program in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering. The two-year collaboration will investigate the thermal and radiolytic behavior of nitrate molten salts, commonly referred to as \"solar salts\", to assess their viability in advanced nuclear energy systems for thermal energy storage and cooling applications. Funded by NANO Nuclear through over $500,000 of research and development investment, the work will be conducted under the supervision of Prof. Koroush Shirvan, Principal Investigator and a leading expert in nuclear systems engineering. The research will focus on the of salt materials subjected to gamma irradiation using MIT’s Gammacell 220F Co-60 irradiator—ensuring a safe, precisely controlled, and highly instrumented test environment. “We are proud to support this world-class irradiation study at MIT,”said Jay Yu, Founder and Chairman of NANO Nuclear.“Understanding how molten salts perform under radiation is essential to unlocking next-generation reactor designs, and this facility gives us the capabilities to do that without the use of any nuclear materials.” While molten nitrate salts are widely used in solar thermal energy systems, the knowledge of these materials’ behavior under the ionizing radiation conditions representative of nuclear environments is relatively scarce. This collaboration aims to fill that critical knowledge gap by assessing both the chemical and thermophysical performance of the salts during and after irradiation. Using a suite of cutting-edge diagnostics, including a magnetic sector residual gas analyzer (RGA), laser flash analysis, and post-irradiation spectroscopic techniques, MIT researchers will measure off-gassing behavior, thermal degradation, and long-term material stability. The results will inform system design for microreactors that utilize molten salts for heat transfer or energy storage, improving the accuracy and reliability of safety and performance models. “This project offers an exciting opportunity to characterize molten nitrate salts in radiation environments with a level of precision not previously achieved,”said Dr. Koroush Shirvan, Principal Investigator at MIT.“We’re using real-time diagnostics, high-temperature test rigs, and modern analytical techniques to generate data that can have immediate impact on next-generation reactor development.” The results of this study will feed directly into the engineering and design processes and could also prove useful for other clean energy applications, including industrial process heat and off-grid energy storage. “We are thrilled to see this groundbreaking research move forward with MIT,”said Professor Ian Farnan, Lead of Nuclear Fuel Cycle, Radiation and Materials of NANO Nuclear. “The ability to assess salt performance in radiation fields without reliance on operating reactor gives us unprecedented flexibility and speed in advancing the development of our reactor systems.” The project is expected to conclude in 2027, with quarterly updates and final data delivery coordinated between MIT and NANO Nuclear’s engineering teams. As NANO Nuclear continues to expand its operations, the Company remains committed to developing cutting-edge nuclear solutions that redefine the global energy landscape. NANO Nuclear Energy Inc.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves Oklo, Inc.OKLO is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on May 13, after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 11 cents per share, suggesting a strong improvement from a loss of $4.79 reported in the prior-year quarter. The bottom-line estimate, however, has deteriorated from nine cents in the past 60 days. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) OKLO’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter. Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for OKLO this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.OKLO has an Earnings ESP of -4.76% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. During the January-March 2025 quarter, Oklo signed some landmark agreements, made a strategic acquisition and achieved some milestones, which are likely to get reflected in its upcoming results.In March, the company acquired Atomic Alchemy, an industry forerunner in radioisotope production. These radioisotopes are used in healthcare, research and defense. Atomic Alchemy’s special VIPR Reactor technology will help Oklo build a strong supply chain in the United States. This deal also supports OKLO’s work in fuel recycling and nuclear energy businesses.In the same month, the company entered into an Interface Agreement with Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to ensure its strict adherence to environmental regulations throughout the site investigation process, and also finalized a Memorandum of Agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), as part of its progress toward deploying its first commercial powerhouse in Idaho.In February, Oklo revealed that it has joined the DOE’s Voucher Program to evaluate and test advanced structural materials for its Aurora powerhouse. This participation is likely to have strengthened OKLO’s path to commercial deployment for its Aurora powerhouse.In the same month, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Lightbridge Corporation to explore co-locating a Lightbridge Commercial-scale Fuel Fabrication Facility at Oklo’s proposed site. This collaboration is expected to have enhanced OKLO’s fuel recycling capabilities, streamlined supply-chain efficiencies and supported its mission to deliver cost-effective, carbon-free energy.In January, Oklo partnered with RPower to deliver a phased power model for data centers, replacing diesel with natural gas by using RPower natural gas generators and ultimately transitioning to a supply of clean, scalable energy from its Aurora powerhouses.With the nuclear fuel sector receiving significant funding in recent times, the aforementioned achievements are likely to have benefited Oklo. Further updates are expected along with the first-quarter results.The company is yet to generate revenues, so its regular operating expenses, associated with developing its next-generation Aurora powerhouses, will continue to put downward pressure on its bottom line, thereby resulting in quarterly losses. Shares of Oklo have surged 48.8% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Alternative-Energy industry’s return of 32.2% as well as the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector’s decline of 13.5%. It has also outpaced the S&P 500’s surge of 7.9% in the same period. A similar stellar performance has been delivered by other industry players, such asBloom EnergyBE andNano Nuclear EnergyNNE, whose shares have surged 40.8% and 365.8%, respectively, over the past year.As one can see below, OKLO’s trailing 12-month Price/Book (P/B) ratio is more than that of its industry and thus trading at a premium. This suggests that investors anticipate the company will generate more profits from its assets compared with its industry. On the contrary, its industry peers are trading at a discount. While Bloom Energy is trading at a trailing 12-month P/B of 6.33X, NNE is trading at 6.7X. The rapid expansion of data centers worldwide, coupled with rising electricity consumption, particularly in emerging economies driven by economic growth, has been fueling global electricity demand. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the United States remains the largest producer of nuclear power, contributing nearly 30% to global nuclear electricity generation, according to the World Nuclear Association.Against this backdrop, Oklo is pioneering next-generation fast-fission power plants, known as “powerhouses.” Its Aurora powerhouse line is designed to generate 15-50 megawatt electric (MWe) from recycled and fresh nuclear fuel, with the potential to scale up to 100 MWe. This positions Oklo for long-term growth in the nuclear power sector.However, the company is yet to generate revenues, with its first Aurora powerhouse expected to be deployed in 2027. This suggests limited top-line performance in the near term. Despite OKLO’s solid performance at the bourses, the company is likely to disappoint its investors with its first-quarter results, taking into account its negative earnings ESP and the downward revision observed in its earnings estimate. Reviewing this, along with the stock’s unfavorable Zacks Rank and premium valuation, investors interested in OKLO may consider letting it go before next Tuesday.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves We came across abearish thesison NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NNE) on wallstreetbets Subreddit Page by Young-faithful. In this article, we will summarize the bears’ thesis on NNE. NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NNE)'s share was trading at $22.75 as of April 30th. NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE), founded in 2022, is a nascent nuclear startup with ambitions to develop the world’s first portable nuclear reactor while also aiming to be a fully vertically integrated player in the sector—handling everything from reactor design and fuel enrichment to transport and consulting. Despite being at an extremely early stage, the company has seen a meteoric rise since its IPO in May 2024, where shares debuted at around $4 and surged over 1000% at their peak, settling around a $1.1 billion market cap. However, NNE’s fundamentals tell a different story. At the time of its IPO, the company had no patents, no working prototypes, no clear regulatory progress, and only a loosely formed technical team. The founder lacks experience in nuclear energy, previously being involved in inconsequential mining ventures, though the CEO does bring credibility with a background in the UK’s Ministry of Defence and Rolls-Royce nuclear programs. The situation drew criticism from Hunterbrook Media, a short-selling firm that spotlighted these issues in 2023. Although the stock initially dropped in response, it rebounded after NNE retained a high-profile attorney and took a litigious stance. Since then, the company has attempted to enhance its legitimacy by acquiring third-party patents, hiring PhDs and advisors, entering non-binding agreements for future collaboration, and seeking research grants. Yet, the timing of these moves has raised concerns that NNE prioritized going public over building a credible business foundation. Compared to OKLO, a nuclear startup that has spent over a decade navigating the technical and regulatory pathways and is only worth 3.5 times NNE’s valuation, the contrast is stark. Posts on technical forums like r/nuclear remain skeptical, criticizing NNE’s unrealistic timelines and lack of demonstrated progress. Despite these concerns, the stock benefits from its eligibility in clean energy ETFs, which has helped institutional ownership reach around 30%, with the rest likely dominated by retail investors. Many in the retail crowd, especially those familiar with companies like OKLO and SMR, may have bought into NNE without realizing how nascent it is in comparison. In essence, NNE is a company whose current valuation seems driven more by hype and optics than by substance or execution. NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NNE) is not on our list of the30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 10 hedge fund portfolios held NNE at the end of the fourth quarter which was 0 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of NNE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

      "content": "New:Introducing “Why Is It Moving?” - lightning-fast, AI-driven explanations of stock moves We recently published a list of12 Best Uranium Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NNE) stands against other uranium stocks to invest in. Nuclear power is making a notable comeback. More than 20 countries pledged to triple nuclear energy by 2050 at the COP28 summit. Nuclear power is considered crucial for lowering emissions, and it is gaining support from both environmental advocates and US national security interests, though for different motivations. Big tech companies are also getting involved as they hunt for more energy to power massive data centers. Uranium is not presently categorized as a “critical mineral” by the US Geological Survey (USGS) because it is classified as a fuel mineral. However, President Trump is pushing for its inclusion in the list, which would gather federal support and speed up project approvals. This seems like a sensible play on Trump’s part, as demand for uranium is climbing, and the US relies almost entirely on imports, with most of the world’s supply originating from a handful of countries. Uranium prices were at a 16-year high in 2023 and, while they have dipped marginally, they remain higher than at any time since Fukushima in 2011. In December 2024, John Ciampaglia, CEO of Sprott Asset Management, told CNBC that the uranium industry had been on life support for nearly a decade after Fukushima, and there needed to be better supply discipline in the market. Uranium producers need to ensure that future supply matches demand. He noted that three factors supported the industry – first, the growing electrification in China, India, and other developing countries, secondly, energy security and decarbonization are putting the focus back on nuclear fuel as an energy source, and third, tech companies are now investing in the development of small modular reactors. He also commented on uranium spot and market prices, which are gradually moving upward. He believes uranium prices need to go higher to incentivize chemical producers and miners to increase production and build new mines, which is critical to developing uranium as a reliable electricity fuel in the coming decades. Current supply shortages, higher long-term prices, and forecasts for record nuclear energy production in 2025 all point to a positive future. With that industry outlook in mind, let’s take a look at the best uranium stocks to buy according to analysts. For this article, we searched credible websites and compiled an extensive list of US-listed uranium stocks.
