Nuclear-related stocks, which have roared higher over the past twelve months amid AI-data center growth expectations, turned mostly positive Friday following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaling that the door is wide open for a rate cut next month.  Heading into Friday's stock market, nuclear stocks had angled lower on the week as the broader AI-dominated stock market paused to consolidate.  S&P 500 nuclear giants Constellation Energy and Vistra ended Friday's stock market down 3.8% and 3.5%, respectively, for the week.
