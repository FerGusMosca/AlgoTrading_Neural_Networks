Context excerpt: competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the European Economic Area. In the second quarter of 2024, we reached a negotiated resolution in this matter. At that time, we had accrued (in accordance with U.S. GAAP), on a pre-tax basis, a liability of \u20ac 337.5 million ($ 376 million). Pursuant to the terms of the agreed settlement, we fulfilled our payment obligation in August 2024. We do not anticipate any modification of our business practices and agreements that would have a material impact on our ongoing business operations within the European Union. Third-Party Guarantees We enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. As of March\u00a031, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Tax Matters",
