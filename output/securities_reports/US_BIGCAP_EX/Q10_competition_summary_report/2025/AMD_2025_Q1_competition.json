Competitors mentioned: Intel, GPU, Data Center, Client, Data Center, AI, Sony, Microsoft, Adaptive SoC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, TSMC, GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc., United Microelectronics Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., ATMP, Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., IT Systems, Confidential Data, AMD, MFA, PII, litigation and/or regulatory, European Union\u2019s, General Data Protection. Context excerpt: Competition is expected to remain intense, driven by rapid technological change, evolving standards, shifting customer preferences, product obsolescence, and frequent product launches from both established and new competitors. Some of our competitors may possess stronger market positions, larger customer bases, more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing, and distribution resources than us. As a result, they may be able to acquire market share or limit our ability to do so, more effectively capitalize on new market opportunities, and transition their products more efficiently than we can. Some competitors are pursuing alternative computing architectures, such as Arm, which could grow the Arm ecosystem and increase competition in consumer, commercial and data center, reducing demand for our products. Additionally, we may encounter competition from customers who internally develop products to support similar AI workloads to those supported by ours. Our competitors may use t",
