Context excerpt: competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in \u201c R egulatory Trends and Uncertainties\u201d and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in \u201cMedical Cost Trends,\u201d which may impact pricing and benefit design in future periods. 14 Table of Contents The Medicaid redetermination process has caused a timing mismatch between the health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates. While the updated rates in 2025 more closely align with underlying member acuity, the funding and payment rate environment remains insufficient to meet the health needs of patients and creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages.
