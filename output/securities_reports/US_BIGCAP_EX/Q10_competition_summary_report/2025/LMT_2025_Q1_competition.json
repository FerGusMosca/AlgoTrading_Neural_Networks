Context excerpt: competition and down-select decision. During the second quarter of 2024, we recorded charges totaling $ 87 million ($ 69 million, or $ 0.29 per share, after-tax) for trademark and fixed asset impairments as well as severance costs resulting from the strategic review of our Sikorsky business during the second quarter of 2024 due, in part, to the impacts of the U.S. Army announcement to cancel the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program at the conclusion of fiscal year 2024, for which our Sikorsky business was competing. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rates were 18.0 % and 16.3 % for the quarter and six months ended June\u00a029, 2025 and 15.8 % for both the quarter and six months ended June\u00a030, 2024. The higher effective income tax rates for the quarter and six months ended June 29, 2025 were primarily attributable to increased interest expense on our uncertain tax position partially offset by changes in pre-tax earnings due to program losses previously described.
