Context excerpt: competition. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, ENBREL and Otezla followed the historic pattern of lower first quarter sales relative to the remainder of the year due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverifications and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced changes in demand for some of our products. The pandemic has interrupted many physician\u2013patient interactions, which has led to delays in diagnoses and treatments, with varying degrees of impact across our portfolio. In general, declines in the sales of our products that were impacted by the dynamics of the pandemic were most significant in the early months of the pandemic, with product demand beginning to show some recovery in late 2020. During 2021, we observed gradual recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, with patient visits and diagnosis rates that approached pre-pandemic levels early in the fourth quarter. However, late in 2021",
