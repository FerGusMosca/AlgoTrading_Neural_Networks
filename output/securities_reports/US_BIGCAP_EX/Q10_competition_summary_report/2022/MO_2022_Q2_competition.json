Context excerpt: competition obligations generally requiring that we participate in the e-vapor business only through JUUL.  However, we have the option to be released from our non-compete obligation (i) in the event JUUL is prohibited by federal law from selling e-vapor products in the United States for a continuous period of at least 12 months (subject to tolling of this period in certain circumstances), (ii) if the carrying value of our investment in JUUL is not more than 10 % of its initial carrying value of $ 12.8 billion or (iii) if we are no longer providing JUUL services as of December 20, 2024.  If any of the conditions described above are met and we elect to be released from our non-competition obligations, we would lose our board designation rights (other than the right to appoint one independent director so long as our ownership continues to be at least 10 %), preemptive rights, consent rights and certain other rights with respect to our investment in JUUL and, in addition, our JUUL shares ",
