Competitors mentioned: Intel, Computing and Graphics, Sony, Microsoft, GPU, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, TSMC, GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc., United Microelectronics Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., ATMP, WSA, AMD, Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., AMD Ryzen, AMD Radeon, AMD EPYC, The White House, SEC, 45 Table of Contents, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection. Context excerpt: competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. In addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. For instance, with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics.
