Competitors mentioned: Sony, Microsoft, GPU, COVID-19, Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, TSMC, GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc., United Microelectronics Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., ATMP, WSA, AMD, Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., AMD Ryzen, AMD Radeon, AMD EPYC, The White House, SEC, MFA, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection. Context excerpt: competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation\u00ae 5, Microsoft\u00ae Xbox TM Series S and Microsoft\u00ae Xbox TM Series X game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft, worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example, China has banned such activities, and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. Alternatively, countries have created and may continue to create their own cryptocurrencies or equivalents that could also impact interest in minin",
