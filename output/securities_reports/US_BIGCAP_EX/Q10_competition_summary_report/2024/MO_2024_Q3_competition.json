Competitors mentioned: FTC, District Court, State, PM USA, UST Litigation, UST, fault and/or contributory. Context excerpt: competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act (\u201cClayton Act\u201d).  In February 2022, the administrative law judge dismissed the FTC\u2019s complaint and, also in February 2022, FTC complaint counsel appealed the administrative law judge\u2019s decision to the FTC.  In March 2023, following our disposition of our investment in JUUL, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.  In June 2023, the FTC dismissed the action as no longer in the public interest. Also as of April 22, 2024, 17 putative class action lawsuits have been filed against Altria and JUUL in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  In November 2020, these lawsuits were consolidated into three complaints (one on behalf of direct purchasers, one on behalf of indirect purchasers and one on behalf of indirect resellers).  The consolidated lawsuits, as amended, cite the FTC administrative complaint and allege that Altria and JUUL violated Sections 1, 2 and/or 3 of the Sherman Act and Section 7",
