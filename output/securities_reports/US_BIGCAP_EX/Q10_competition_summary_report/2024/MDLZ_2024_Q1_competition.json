Context excerpt: competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the European Economic Area. On January 28, 2021, the European Commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. As previously disclosed, we have cooperated with the investigation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we had accrued (in accordance with U.S. GAAP), on a pre-tax basis, a liability of \u20ac 300 million ($ 321 million) within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings as an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we adjusted our accrual to a liability of \u20ac 340 million ($ 375 million). In the second quarter of 2024, we reached a negotiated resolution in this matter and adjusted our accrual from a liability of \u20ac 340 million to \u20ac 337.5 million ($ 376 million), on a pre-tax basis.
