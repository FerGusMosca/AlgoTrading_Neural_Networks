In the fourth quarter of 2022, we had accrued (in accordance with U.S. GAAP), on a pre-tax basis, a liability of \u20ac 300 million ($ 321 million) within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings as an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we adjusted our accrual to a liability of \u20ac 340 million ($ 375 million). In the second quarter of 2024, we reached a 23 Table of Contents negotiated resolution in this matter and adjusted our accrual from a liability of \u20ac 340 million to \u20ac 337.5 million ($ 362 million",
