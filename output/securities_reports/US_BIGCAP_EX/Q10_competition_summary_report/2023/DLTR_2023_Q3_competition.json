Context excerpt: competition, inflation and changes in the product assortment, pricing, or quality. Sales vary at our existing 15 Table of Contents stores from one year to the next. We refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. We include sales from stores expanded or remodeled during the period in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term \u2018expanded\u2019 also includes stores that are relocated. Stores that have been re-bannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand. Sales that are excluded from the calculation of comparable store net sales are referred to as non-comparable store sales and consist of sales from new stores",
