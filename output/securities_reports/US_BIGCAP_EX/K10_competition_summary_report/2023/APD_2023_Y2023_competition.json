Competitors mentioned: ISO, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's, Nitrogen, Argon, Industrial Gases Equipment, Corporate, LNG, Gardner Cryogenics, Governmental Contracts, Business Segment and Geographic Information, Basis of Presentation, Major Accounting Policies, Financial Instruments, Industrial Gases. Context excerpt: Competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications. We derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide a reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers. Production Industrial gases are generally produced at or near the point of use given the complexity and inefficiency of storing molecules at low temperatures. The industrial gases business develops, builds, and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases. Atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes, of which cryogenic distillation is the most prevalent, while process gases are produced by methods other than air separation. To produce hydrogen, we purify byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries. We have historically produced hydrogen from hydrocarbons exclusively without carbon capture (known as \"gray hyd",
