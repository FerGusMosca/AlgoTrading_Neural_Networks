Context excerpt: Competition in the Computing and Graphics Segment The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of microprocessors is Intel Corporation (Intel). A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the PC market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem. In 2020, NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA), our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market, announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point. In the graphics market, our principal competitor in the supply of discrete graphics is NVIDIA who is the market share leader. Intel also manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor",
