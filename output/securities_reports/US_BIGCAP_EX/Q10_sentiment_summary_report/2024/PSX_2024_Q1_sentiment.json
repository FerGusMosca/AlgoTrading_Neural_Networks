    "Although the easement is vacated, the USACE has no plans to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the EIS, and the Tribe\u2019s request for a shutdown was denied in May 2021.",
    "The options comprise two \u201cno action\u201d alternatives where the USACE would deny an easement to Dakota Access and require it to shut down the pipeline and either remove the pipe from under Lake Oahe or allow the pipeline to be abandoned-in-place under the lake.",
    "The USACE also identified three \u201caction\u201d alternatives; two of them contemplate that the USACE would reissue the easement to Dakota Access under essentially the same terms as 2017 with either the same or a larger volume of oil allowed through the pipeline, while the third alternative would require decommissioning of the current pipeline and construction of a new line 39 miles upstream from the current location."
