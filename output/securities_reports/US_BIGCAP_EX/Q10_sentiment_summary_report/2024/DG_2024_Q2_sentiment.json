Accordingly, we expect our customers\u2019 spending to continue to be pressured overall and particularly in our non-consumables categories. As a result of this pressure, we anticipate a heavier promotional environment in the second half of 2024, which could have an impact on our sales and margin results. \u200b We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customer-centric focus. \u200b As we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers\u2019 affordability needs, we remain focused on enhancing our margins through inventory shrink and damage reduction initiatives, as well as pricing and markdown optimization, effective category management and inventory reduction efforts, distribution and transportation efficiencies, private brands penetration and global sourcing."
