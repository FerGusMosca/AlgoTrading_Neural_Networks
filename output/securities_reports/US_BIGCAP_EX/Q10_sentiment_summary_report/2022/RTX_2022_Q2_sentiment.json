Forward-looking snippets: We will continue to monitor future developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. However, we continue to see that commercial air travel is recovering in certain areas of demand. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels.
