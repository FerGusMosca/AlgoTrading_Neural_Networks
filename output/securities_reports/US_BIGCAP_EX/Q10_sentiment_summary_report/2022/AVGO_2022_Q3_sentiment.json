Forward-looking snippets: Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers . The new guidance requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , as if it had originated the contracts. Revenue from Contracts with Customers We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party\u2019s rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Disaggregation We have considered (1) information that is regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (the \u201cCODM\u201d) as defined by the authoritative guidance on segment reporting, in evaluating financial performance and (2) disclosures presented outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues. We expect approximately 28 % of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months."
