We expect costs associated with this initial part of the program to continue primarily through 2025 and to total approximately $ 3.1 billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, exit and implementation costs as well as non-cash asset write downs of which $ 2.4 billion is associated with our Biopharma segment. We expect costs associated with the additional productivity opportunities to be incurred through 2027 and to total approximately $ 1.6 billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, digital enablement and implementation, of which $ 700 million is associated with our Biopharma segment. We expect costs to implement these initiatives to be incurred through 2026 and to total approximately $ 600 million, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, digital enablement and implementation, all of which is associated with our Biopharma segment. We expect costs associated with all three components of this program to total approximately $ 5.3 billion of which $ 3.7 billion is associated with the Biopharma segment."
