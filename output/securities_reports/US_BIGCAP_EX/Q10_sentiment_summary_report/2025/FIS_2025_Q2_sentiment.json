We expect to fund the Issuer Solutions Acquisition through a combination of approximately $ 8.0 billion of new debt and the after-tax proceeds from the Worldpay Minority Interest Sale. We will continue to account for our non-controlling 45 % equity interest in Worldpay using the equity method of accounting until the completion of the transactions. Upon closing of the Worldpay Minority Interest Sale, we expect to record a gain equal to the excess of the estimated $ 6.6 billion pre-tax net selling price over the carrying value of the Worldpay equity method investment."
